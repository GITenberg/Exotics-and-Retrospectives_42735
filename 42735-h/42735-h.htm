<p class="p4 break-before">All but one of the papers composing this
volume appear for the first time. The
little essays, or rather fantasies, forming
the second part of the book, deal with experiences
in two hemispheres; but their general title should
explain why they have been arranged independently
of that fact. To any really scientific imagination,
the curious analogy existing between
certain teachings of evolutional psychology and
certain teachings of Eastern faith,&mdash;particularly
the Buddhist doctrine that all sense-life is Karma,
and all substance only the phenomenal result of
acts and thoughts,&mdash;might have suggested something
much more significant than my cluster of
<i>Retrospectives</i>. These are offered merely as intimations
of a truth incomparably less difficult to
recognize than to define.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Seen on close approach, the mountain of Fuji does not
come up to expectation.&mdash;<i>Japanese proverbial philosophy.</i></p></div>


<p>The most beautiful sight in Japan, and certainly
one of the most beautiful in the
world, is the distant apparition of Fuji on
cloudless days,&mdash;more especially days of spring
and autumn, when the greater part of the peak
is covered with late or with early snows. You
can seldom distinguish the snowless base, which
remains the same color as the sky: you perceive
only the white cone seeming to hang in heaven;
and the Japanese comparison of its shape to an
inverted half-open fan is made wonderfully exact
by the fine streaks that spread downward from
the notched top, like shadows of fan-ribs. Even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
lighter than a fan the vision appears,&mdash;rather
the ghost or dream of a fan;&mdash;yet the material
reality a hundred miles away is grandiose among
the mountains of the globe. Rising to a height
of nearly 12,500 feet, Fuji is visible from thirteen
provinces of the Empire. Nevertheless it is one
of the easiest of lofty mountains to climb; and
for a thousand years it has been scaled every
summer by multitudes of pilgrims. For it is
not only a sacred mountain, but the most sacred
mountain of Japan,&mdash;the holiest eminence of
the land that is called Divine,&mdash;the Supreme
Altar of the Sun;&mdash;and to ascend it at least once
in a life-time is the duty of all who reverence
the ancient gods. So from every district of the
Empire pilgrims annually wend their way to
Fuji; and in nearly all the provinces there are
pilgrim-societies&mdash;<i>Fuji-Kō</i>,&mdash;organized for the
purpose of aiding those desiring to visit the
sacred peak. If this act of faith cannot be performed
by everybody in person, it can at least
be performed by proxy. Any hamlet, however
remote, can occasionally send one representative
to pray before the shrine of the divinity of Fuji,
and to salute the rising sun from that sublime
eminence. Thus a single company of Fuji-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>pilgrims
may be composed of men from a hundred
different settlements.</p>

<p>By both of the national religions Fuji is held in
reverence. The Shintō deity of Fuji is the beautiful
goddess Ko-no-hana-saku-ya-himé,&mdash;she
who brought forth her children in fire without
pain, and whose name signifies “Radiant-blooming-as-the-flowers-of-the-trees,”
or, according to
some commentators, “Causing-the-flowers-to-blossom-brightly.”
On the summit is her
temple; and in ancient books it is recorded that
mortal eyes have beheld her hovering, like a
luminous cloud, above the verge of the crater.
Her viewless servants watch and wait by the
precipices to hurl down whomsoever presumes
to approach her shrine with unpurified heart....
Buddhism loves the grand peak because its form
is like the white bud of the Sacred Flower,&mdash;and
because the eight cusps of its top, like the
eight petals of the Lotos, symbolize the Eight
Intelligences of Perception, Purpose, Speech,
Conduct, Living, Effort, Mindfulness, and Contemplation.</p>

<p>But the legends and traditions about Fuji, the
stories of its rising out of the earth in a single
night,&mdash;of the shower of pierced-jewels once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
flung down from it,&mdash;of the first temple built
upon its summit eleven hundred years ago,&mdash;of
the Luminous Maiden that lured to the crater
an Emperor who was never seen afterward, but is
still worshipped at a little shrine erected on the
place of his vanishing,&mdash;of the sand that daily
rolled down by pilgrim feet nightly reascends to
its former position,&mdash;have not all these things
been written in books? There is really very little
left for me to tell about Fuji except my own
experience of climbing it.</p>

<p>I made the ascent by way of Gotemba,&mdash;the
least picturesque, but perhaps also the least difficult
of the six or seven routes open to choice.
Gotemba is a little village chiefly consisting of
pilgrim-inns. You reach it from Tōkyō in about
three hours by the Tōkaidō railway, which rises
for miles as it approaches the neighborhood of
the mighty volcano. Gotemba is considerably
more than two thousand feet above the sea, and
therefore comparatively cool in the hottest season.
The open country about it slopes to Fuji; but the
slope is so gradual that the table-land seems
almost level to the eye. From Gotemba in perfectly
clear weather the mountain looks uncomfortably
near,&mdash;formidable by proximity,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>though
actually miles away. During the rainy
season it may appear and disappear alternately
many times in one day,&mdash;like an enormous
spectre. But on the grey August morning when
I entered Gotemba as a pilgrim, the landscape
was muffled in vapors; and Fuji was totally
invisible. I arrived too late to attempt the ascent
on the same day; but I made my preparations at
once for the day following, and engaged a couple
of <i>gōriki</i> (“strong-pull men”), or experienced
guides. I felt quite secure on seeing their broad
honest faces and sturdy bearing. They supplied
me with a pilgrim-staff, heavy blue <i>tabi</i> (that is
to say, cleft-stockings, to be used with sandals), a
straw hat shaped like Fuji, and the rest of a
pilgrim’s outfit;&mdash;telling me to be ready to
start with them at four o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p>What is hereafter set down consists of notes
taken on the journey, but afterwards amended
and expanded,&mdash;for notes made while climbing
are necessarily hurried and imperfect.</p>

<p class="date">
August 24th, 1897.
</p>

<p>From strings stretched above the balcony upon
which my inn-room opens, hundreds of towels
are hung like flags,&mdash;blue towels and white,
having printed upon them in Chinese characters
the names of pilgrim-companies and of the
divinity of Fuji. These are gifts to the house,
and serve as advertisements.... Raining from
a uniformly grey sky. Fuji always invisible.</p>


<p class="date">
August 25th.
</p>

<p>3:30 <i>a. m.</i>&mdash;No sleep;&mdash;tumult all night
of parties returning late from the mountain, or
arriving for the pilgrimage;&mdash;constant clapping
of hands to summon servants;&mdash;banqueting and
singing in the adjoining chambers, with alarming
bursts of laughter every few minutes....
Breakfast of soup, fish, and rice. Gōriki arrive
in professional costume, and find me ready.
Nevertheless they insist that I shall undress again
and put on heavy underclothing;&mdash;warning me
that even when it is Doyō (the period of greatest
summer heat) at the foot of the mountain, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Daikan (the period of greatest winter cold) at
the top. Then they start in advance, carrying
provisions and bundles of heavy clothing....
A kuruma waits for me, with three runners,&mdash;two
to pull, and one to push, as the work will be
hard uphill. By kuruma I can go to the height
of five thousand feet.</p>

<p class="tbpara">Morning black and slightly chill, with fine
rain; but I shall soon be above the rain-clouds....
The lights of the town vanish behind us;&mdash;the
kuruma is rolling along a country-road.
Outside of the swinging penumbra made by the
paper-lantern of the foremost runner, nothing
is clearly visible; but I can vaguely distinguish
silhouettes of trees and, from time to time, of
houses,&mdash;peasants’ houses with steep roofs.</p>

<p class="tbpara">Grey wan light slowly suffuses the moist
air;&mdash;day is dawning through drizzle....
Gradually the landscape defines with its colors.
The way lies through thin woods. Occasionally
we pass houses with high thatched roofs that
look like farmhouses; but cultivated land is
nowhere visible....</p>

<p class="tbpara">Open country with scattered clumps of trees,&mdash;larch
and pine. Nothing in the horizon but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
scraggy tree-tops above what seems to be the rim
of a vast down. No sign whatever of Fuji....
For the first time I notice that the road is black,&mdash;black
sand and cinders apparently, volcanic
cinders: the wheels of the kuruma and the feet
of the runners sink into it with a crunching
sound.</p>

<p class="tbpara">The rain has stopped, and the sky becomes
a clearer grey.... The trees decrease in size
and number as we advance.</p>

<p class="tbpara">What I have been taking for the horizon, in
front of us, suddenly breaks open, and begins to
roll smokily away to left and right. In the great
rift part of a dark-blue mass appears,&mdash;a portion
of Fuji. Almost at the same moment the sun
pierces the clouds behind us; but the road now
enters a copse covering the base of a low ridge,
and the view is cut off.... Halt at a little
house among the trees,&mdash;a pilgrims’ resting-place,&mdash;and
there find the gōriki, who have
advanced much more rapidly than my runners,
waiting for us. Buy eggs, which a gōriki rolls
up in a narrow strip of straw matting;&mdash;tying
the matting tightly with straw cord between the
eggs,&mdash;so that the string of eggs has somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the appearance of a string of sausages....
Hire a horse.</p>

<p class="tbpara">Sky clears as we proceed;&mdash;white sunlight
floods everything. Road reascends; and we
emerge again on the moorland. And, right in
front, Fuji appears,&mdash;naked to the summit,&mdash;stupendous,&mdash;startling
as if newly risen from
the earth. Nothing could be more beautiful.
A vast blue cone,&mdash;warm-blue, almost violet
through the vapors not yet lifted by the sun,&mdash;with
two white streaklets near the top which
are great gullies full of snow, though they look
from here scarcely an inch long. But the charm
of the apparition is much less the charm of color
than of symmetry,&mdash;a symmetry of beautiful
bending lines with a curve like the curve of a
cable stretched over a space too wide to allow of
pulling taut. (This comparison did not at once
suggest itself: The first impression given me by
the grace of those lines was an impression of
femininity;&mdash;I found myself thinking of some
exquisite sloping of shoulders towards the neck.)
I can imagine nothing more difficult to draw at
sight. But the Japanese artist, through his marvellous
skill with the writing-brush,&mdash;the skill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
inherited from generations of calligraphists,&mdash;easily
faces the riddle: he outlines the silhouette
with two flowing strokes made in the fraction of
a second, and manages to hit the exact truth of
the curves,&mdash;much as a professional archer might
hit a mark, without consciously taking aim,
through long exact habit of hand and eye.</p>




<h4>II</h4>


<p>I see the gōriki hurrying forward far away,&mdash;one
of them carrying the eggs round his neck!...
Now there are no more trees worthy of the
name,&mdash;only scattered stunted growths resembling
shrubs. The black road curves across a vast
grassy down; and here and there I see large black
patches in the green surface,&mdash;bare spaces of ashes
and scoriæ; showing that this thin green skin
covers some enormous volcanic deposit of recent
date.... As a matter of history, all this district
was buried two yards deep in 1707 by an eruption
from the side of Fuji. Even in far-off Tōkyō
the rain of ashes covered roofs to a depth of sixteen
centimetres. There are no farms in this
region, because there is little true soil; and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
is no water. But volcanic destruction is not eternal
destruction; eruptions at last prove fertilizing;
and the divine “Princess-who-causes-the-flowers-to-blossom-brightly”
will make this waste to smile
again in future hundreds of years.</p>

<p class="tbpara">... The black openings in the green surface
become more numerous and larger. A few
dwarf-shrubs still mingle with the coarse grass....
The vapors are lifting; and Fuji is changing color.
It is no longer a glowing blue, but a dead sombre
blue. Irregularities previously hidden by rising
ground appear in the lower part of the grand
curves. One of these to the left,&mdash;shaped like
a camel’s hump,&mdash;represents the focus of the last
great eruption.</p>

<p class="tbpara">The land is not now green with black patches,
but black with green patches; and the green
patches dwindle visibly in the direction of the
peak. The shrubby growths have disappeared.
The wheels of the kuruma, and the feet of the
runners sink deeper into the volcanic sand....
The horse is now attached to the kuruma with
ropes, and I am able to advance more rapidly.
Still the mountain seems far away; but we are
really running up its flank at a height of more
than five thousand feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p class="tbpara">Fuji has ceased to be blue of any shade. It is
black,&mdash;charcoal-black,&mdash;a frightful extinct heap
of visible ashes and cinders and slaggy lava....
Most of the green has disappeared. Likewise all
of the illusion. The tremendous naked black
reality,&mdash;always becoming more sharply, more
grimly, more atrociously defined,&mdash;is a stupefaction,
a nightmare.... Above&mdash;miles above&mdash;the
snow patches glare and gleam against that
blackness,&mdash;hideously. I think of a gleam of
white teeth I once saw in a skull,&mdash;a woman’s
skull,&mdash;otherwise burnt to a sooty crisp.</p>

<p class="tbpara">So one of the fairest, if not the fairest of earthly
visions, resolves itself into a spectacle of horror
and death.... But have not all human ideals
of beauty, like the beauty of Fuji seen from afar,
been created by forces of death and pain?&mdash;are
not all, in their kind, but composites of death,
beheld in retrospective through the magical haze
of inherited memory?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>




<h4>III</h4>


<p>The green has utterly vanished;&mdash;all is black.
There is no road,&mdash;only the broad waste of
black sand sloping and narrowing up to those
dazzling, grinning patches of snow. But there
is a track,&mdash;a yellowish track made by thousands
and thousands of cast-off sandals of straw
(<i>waraji</i>), flung aside by pilgrims. Straw sandals
quickly wear out upon this black grit; and every
pilgrim carries several pair for the journey. Had
I to make the ascent alone, I could find the path
by following that wake of broken sandals,&mdash;a
yellow streak zigzagging up out of sight across
the blackness.</p>

<p class="tbpara">6:40 <i>a. m.</i>&mdash;We reach Tarōbō, first of the
ten stations on the ascent: height, 6000 feet.
The station is a large wooden house, of which
two rooms have been fitted up as a shop for the
sale of staves, hats, raincoats, sandals,&mdash;everything
pilgrims need. I find there a peripatetic
photographer offering for sale photographs of
the mountain which are really very good as
well as very cheap.... Here the gōriki take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
their first meal; and I rest. The kuruma can
go no further; and I dismiss my three runners,
but keep the horse,&mdash;a docile and surefooted
creature; for I can venture to ride him up to
<i>Ni-gō-goséki</i>, or Station No. 2&frac12;.</p>

<p class="tbpara">Start for No. 2&frac12; up the slant of black sand,
keeping the horse at a walk. No. 2&frac12; is shut up
for the season.... Slope now becomes steep
as a stairway, and further riding would be dangerous.
Alight and make ready for the climb.
Cold wind blowing so strongly that I have to tie
on my hat tightly. One of the gōriki unwinds
from about his waist a long stout cotton girdle,
and giving me one end to hold, passes the other
over his shoulder for the pull. Then he proceeds
over the sand at an angle, with a steady short
step, and I follow; the other guide keeping
closely behind me to provide against any slip.</p>

<p class="tbpara">There is nothing very difficult about this climbing,
except the weariness of walking through
sand and cinders: it is like walking over dunes....
We mount by zigzags. The sand moves
with the wind; and I have a slightly nervous
sense&mdash;the feeling only, not the perception; for
I keep my eyes on the sand,&mdash;of height growing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
above depth.... Have to watch my steps carefully,
and to use my staff constantly, as the slant
is now very steep.... We are in a white fog,&mdash;passing
through clouds! Even if I wished
to look back, I could see nothing through this
vapor; but I have not the least wish to look
back. The wind has suddenly ceased&mdash;cut off,
perhaps, by a ridge; and there is a silence that I
remember from West Indian days: the Peace of
High Places. It is broken only by the crunching
of the ashes beneath our feet. I can distinctly
hear my heart beat.... The guide tells me
that I stoop too much,&mdash;orders me to walk
upright, and always in stepping to put down the
heel first. I do this, and find it relieving. But
climbing through this tiresome mixture of ashes
and sand begins to be trying. I am perspiring
and panting. The guide bids me keep my honorable
mouth closed, and breathe only through
my honorable nose.</p>

<p class="tbpara">We are out of the fog again.... All at once
I perceive above us, at a little distance, something
like a square hole in the face of the
mountain,&mdash;a door! It is the door of the third
station,&mdash;a wooden hut half-buried in black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
drift.... How delightful to squat again,&mdash;even
in a blue cloud of wood-smoke and under
smoke-blackened rafters! Time, 8:30 a. m.
Height, 7,085 feet.</p>

<p class="tbpara">In spite of the wood-smoke the station is comfortable
enough inside; there are clean mattings
and even kneeling-cushions. No windows, of
course, nor any other opening than the door;
for the building is half-buried in the flank of the
mountain. We lunch.... The station-keeper
tells us that recently a student walked from
Gotemba to the top of the mountain and back
again&mdash;in geta! Geta are heavy wooden sandals,
or clogs, held to the foot only by a thong
passing between the great and the second toe.
The feet of that student must have been made
of steel!</p>

<p>Having rested, I go out to look around. Far
below white clouds are rolling over the landscape
in huge fluffy wreaths. Above the hut, and
actually trickling down over it, the sable cone
soars to the sky. But the amazing sight is the
line of the monstrous slope to the left,&mdash;a line
that now shows no curve whatever, but shoots
down below the clouds, and up to the gods only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
know where (for I cannot see the end of it),
straight as a tightened bowstring. The right flank
is rocky and broken. But as for the left,&mdash;I
never dreamed it possible that a line so absolutely
straight and smooth, and extending for so enormous
a distance at such an amazing angle, could
exist even in a volcano. That stupendous pitch
gives me a sense of dizziness, and a totally unfamiliar
feeling of wonder. Such regularity appears
unnatural, frightful; seems even artificial,&mdash;but
artificial upon a superhuman and demoniac
scale. I imagine that to fall thence from
above would be to fall for leagues. Absolutely
nothing to take hold of. But the gōriki assure
me that there is no danger on that slope: it is all
soft sand.</p>




<h4>IV</h4>


<p>Though drenched with perspiration by the exertion
of the first climb, I am already dry, and cold....
Up again.... The ascent is at first through
ashes and sand as before; but presently large stones
begin to mingle with the sand; and the way is
always growing steeper.... I constantly slip.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
There is nothing firm, nothing resisting to stand
upon: loose stones and cinders roll down at every
step.... If a big lava-block were to detach itself
from above!... In spite of my helpers and of
the staff, I continually slip, and am all in perspiration
again. Almost every stone that I tread
upon turns under me. How is it that no stone
ever turns under the feet of the gōriki? <i>They</i>
never slip,&mdash;never make a false step,&mdash;never
seem less at ease than they would be in walking
over a matted floor. Their small brown broad feet
always poise upon the shingle at exactly the right
angle. They are heavier men than I; but they
move lightly as birds.... Now I have to stop
for rest every half-a-dozen steps.... The line
of broken straw sandals follows the zigzags we
take.... At last&mdash;at last another door in the
face of the mountain. Enter the fourth station,
and fling myself down upon the mats. Time,
10:30 a. m. Height, only 7,937 feet;&mdash;yet it
seemed such a distance!</p>

<p class="tbpara">Off again.... Way worse and worse....
Feel a new distress due to the rarefaction of the
air. Heart beating as in a high fever.... Slope
has become very rough. It is no longer soft ashes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and sand mixed with stones, but stones only,&mdash;fragments
of lava, lumps of pumice, scoriæ of
every sort, all angled as if freshly broken with a
hammer. All would likewise seem to have been
expressly shaped so as to turn upside-down when
trodden upon. Yet I must confess that they never
turn under the feet of the gōriki.... The cast-off
sandals strew the slope in ever-increasing numbers....
But for the gōriki I should have had
ever so many bad tumbles: they cannot prevent
me from slipping; but they never allow me to
fall. Evidently I am not fitted to climb mountains....
Height, 8,659 feet&mdash;but the fifth
station is shut up! Must keep zigzaging on to
the next. Wonder how I shall ever be able to
reach it!... And there are people still alive
who have climbed Fuji three and four times, <i>for
pleasure</i>!... Dare not look back. See nothing
but the black stones always turning under me,
and the bronzed feet of those marvellous gōriki
who never slip, never pant, and never perspire....
Staff begins to hurt my hand.... Gōriki
push and pull: it is shameful of me, I know, to
give them so much trouble.... Ah! sixth station!&mdash;may
all the myriads of the gods bless my
gōriki! Time, 2:07 p. m. Height, 9,317 feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p class="tbpara">Resting, I gaze through the doorway at the
abyss below. The land is now dimly visible only
through rents in a prodigious wilderness of white
clouds; and within these rents everything looks
almost black.... The horizon has risen frightfully,&mdash;has
expanded monstrously.... My
gōriki warn me that the summit is still miles
away. I have been too slow. We must hasten
upward.</p>

<p class="tbpara">Certainly the zigzag is steeper than before....
With the stones now mingle angular rocks;
and we sometimes have to flank queer black
bulks that look like basalt.... On the right
rises, out of sight, a jagged black hideous ridge,&mdash;an
ancient lava-stream. The line of the left
slope still shoots up, straight as a bow-string....
Wonder if the way will become any steeper;&mdash;doubt
whether it can possibly become any
rougher. Rocks dislodged by my feet roll down
soundlessly;&mdash;I am afraid to look after them.
Their noiseless vanishing gives me a sensation
like the sensation of falling in dreams....</p>

<p class="tbpara">There is a white gleam overhead&mdash;the lowermost
verge of an immense stretch of snow....
Now we are skirting a snow-filled gully,&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
lowermost of those white patches which, at first
sight of the summit this morning, seemed scarcely
an inch long. It will take an hour to pass it....
A guide runs forward, while I rest upon my staff,
and returns with a large ball of snow. What
curious snow! Not flaky, soft, white snow, but
a mass of transparent globules,&mdash;exactly like
glass beads. I eat some, and find it deliciously
refreshing.... The seventh station is closed.
How shall I get to the eighth?... Happily,
breathing has become less difficult.... The
wind is upon us again, and black dust with it.
The gōriki keep close to me, and advance with
caution.... I have to stop for rest at every turn
on the path;&mdash;cannot talk for weariness....
I do not feel;&mdash;I am much too tired to feel....
How I managed it, I do not know;&mdash;but I have
actually got to the eighth station! Not for
a thousand millions of dollars will I go one step
further to-day. Time, 4:40 p. m. Height, 10,693
feet.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>




<h4>V</h4>


<p>It is much too cold here for rest without winter
clothing; and now I learn the worth of the heavy
robes provided by the guides. The robes are blue,
with big white Chinese characters on the back,
and are padded thickly as bedquilts; but they feel
light; for the air is really like the frosty breath
of February.... A meal is preparing;&mdash;I notice
that charcoal at this elevation acts in a refractory
manner, and that a fire can be maintained only
by constant attention.... Cold and fatigue
sharpen appetite: we consume a surprising quantity
of <i>Zō-sui</i>,&mdash;rice boiled with eggs and a
little meat. By reason of my fatigue and of the
hour, it has been decided to remain here for the
night.</p>

<p class="tbpara">Tired as I am, I cannot but limp to the doorway
to contemplate the amazing prospect. From
within a few feet of the threshold, the ghastly
slope of rocks and cinders drops down into a prodigious
disk of clouds miles beneath us,&mdash;clouds
of countless forms, but mostly wreathings and
fluffy pilings;&mdash;and the whole huddling mass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
reaching almost to the horizon, is blinding white
under the sun. (By the Japanese, this tremendous
cloud-expanse is well named <i>Wata-no-Umi</i>, “the
Sea of Cotton.”) The horizon itself&mdash;enormously
risen, phantasmally expanded&mdash;seems halfway
up above the world: a wide luminous belt
ringing the hollow vision. Hollow, I call it, because
extreme distances below the sky-line are
sky-colored and vague,&mdash;so that the impression
you receive is not of being on a point under a
vault, but of being upon a point rising into a stupendous
blue sphere, of which this huge horizon
would represent the equatorial zone. To turn
away from such a spectacle is not possible. I
watch and watch until the dropping sun changes
the colors,&mdash;turning the Sea of Cotton into a
Fleece of Gold. Half-round the horizon a yellow
glory grows and burns. Here and there beneath
it, through cloudrifts, colored vaguenesses define:
I now see golden water, with long purple headlands
reaching into it, with ranges of violet peaks
thronging behind it;&mdash;these glimpses curiously
resembling portions of a tinted topographical map.
Yet most of the landscape is pure delusion. Even
my guides, with their long experience and their
eagle-sight, can scarcely distinguish the real from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the unreal;&mdash;for the blue and purple and violet
clouds moving under the Golden Fleece, exactly
mock the outlines and the tones of distant peaks
and capes: you can detect what is vapor only
by its slowly shifting shape.... Brighter and
brighter glows the gold. Shadows come from the
west,&mdash;shadows flung by cloud-pile over cloud-pile;
and these, like evening shadows upon snow,
are violaceous blue.... Then orange-tones appear
in the horizon; then smouldering crimson.
And now the greater part of the Fleece of Gold
has changed to cotton again,&mdash;white cotton
mixed with pink.... Stars thrill out. The
cloud-waste uniformly whitens;&mdash;thickening
and packing to the horizon. The west glooms.
Night rises; and all things darken except that
wondrous unbroken world-round of white,&mdash;the
Sea of Cotton.</p>

<p class="tbpara">The station-keeper lights his lamps, kindles a
fire of twigs, prepares our beds. Outside it is
bitterly cold, and, with the fall of night, becoming
colder. Still I cannot turn away from that astounding
vision.... Countless stars now flicker and
shiver in the blue-black sky. Nothing whatever
of the material world remains visible, except the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
black slope of the peak before my feet. The
enormous cloud-disk below continues white; but
to all appearance it has become a liquidly level
white, without forms,&mdash;a white flood. It is no
longer the Sea of Cotton. It is a Sea of Milk,
the Cosmic Sea of ancient Indian legend,&mdash;and
always self-luminous, as with ghostly quickenings.</p>




<h4>VI</h4>


<p>Squatting by the wood fire, I listen to the gōriki
and the station-keeper telling of strange happenings
on the mountain. One incident discussed I
remember reading something about in a Tōkyō
paper: I now hear it retold by the lips of a man
who figured in it as a hero.</p>

<p>A Japanese meteorologist named Nonaka, attempted
last year the rash undertaking of passing
the winter on the summit of Fuji for purposes of
scientific study. It might not be difficult to winter
upon the peak in a solid observatory furnished
with a good stove, and all necessary comforts;
but Nonaka could afford only a small wooden
hut, in which he would be obliged to spend the
cold season <i>without fire</i>! His young wife in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>sisted
on sharing his labors and dangers. The
couple began their sojourn on the summit toward
the close of September. In midwinter news was
brought to Gotemba that both were dying.</p>

<p>Relatives and friends tried to organize a rescue-party.
But the weather was frightful; the peak
was covered with snow and ice; the chances of
death were innumerable; and the gōriki would
not risk their lives. Hundreds of dollars could
not tempt them. At last a desperate appeal was
made to them as representatives of Japanese
courage and hardihood: they were assured that
to suffer a man of science to perish, without
making even one plucky effort to save him,
would disgrace the country;&mdash;they were told
that the national honor was in their hands. This
appeal brought forward two volunteers. One
was a man of great strength and daring, nick-named
by his fellow-guides, <i>Oni-guma</i>, “the
Demon-Bear,” the other was the elder of my
gōriki. Both believed that they were going to
certain destruction. They took leave of their
friends and kindred, and drank with their families
the farewell cup of water,&mdash;<i>midzu-no-sakazuki</i>,&mdash;in
which those about to be separated by death
pledge each other. Then, after having thickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
wrapped themselves in cotton-wool, and made all
possible preparation for ice climbing, they started,&mdash;taking
with them a brave army-surgeon who
had offered his services, without fee, for the
rescue. After surmounting extraordinary difficulties,
the party reached the hut; but the inmates
refused to open! Nonaka protested that
he would rather die than face the shame of failure
in his undertaking; and his wife said that she
had resolved to die with her husband. Partly by
forcible, and partly by gentle means, the pair
were restored to a better state of mind. The
surgeon administered medicines and cordials; the
patients, carefully wrapped up, were strapped to
the backs of the guides; and the descent was
begun. My gōriki, who carried the lady, believes
that the gods helped him on the ice-slopes. More
than once, all thought themselves lost; but they
reached the foot of the mountain without one
serious mishap. After weeks of careful nursing,
the rash young couple were pronounced out of
danger. The wife suffered less, and recovered
more quickly, than the husband.</p>

<p class="tbpara">The gōriki have cautioned me not to venture
outside during the night without calling them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
They will not tell me why; and their warning is
peculiarly uncanny. From previous experiences
during Japanese travel, I surmise that the danger
implied is supernatural; but I feel that it would
be useless to ask questions.</p>

<p>The door is closed and barred. I lie down
between the guides, who are asleep in a moment,
as I can tell by their heavy breathing. I cannot
sleep immediately;&mdash;perhaps the fatigues and
the surprises of the day have made me somewhat
nervous. I look up at the rafters of the black
roof,&mdash;at packages of sandals, bundles of wood,
bundles of many indistinguishable kinds there
stowed away or suspended, and making queer
shadows in the lamplight.... It is terribly cold,
even under my three quilts; and the sound of the
wind outside is wonderfully like the sound of
great surf,&mdash;a constant succession of bursting
roars, each followed by a prolonged hiss. The
hut, half buried under tons of rock and drift,
does not move; but the sand does, and trickles
down between the rafters; and small stones also
move after each fierce gust, with a rattling just
like the clatter of shingle in the pull of a retreating
wave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p class="tbpara">4. <i>a. m.</i>&mdash;Go out alone, despite last evening’s
warning, but keep close to the door. There is a
great and icy blowing. The Sea of Milk is unchanged: it
lies far below this wind. Over it the
moon is dying.... The guides, perceiving my
absence, spring up and join me. I am reproved
for not having awakened them. They will not let
me stay outside alone: so I turn in with them.</p>

<p class="tbpara">Dawn: a zone of pearl grows round the
world. The stars vanish; the sky brightens. A
wild sky, with dark wrack drifting at an enormous
height. The Sea of Milk has turned again into
Cotton,&mdash;and there are wide rents in it. The
desolation of the black slope,&mdash;all the ugliness of
slaggy rock and angled stone, again defines....
Now the cotton becomes disturbed;&mdash;it is breaking
up. A yellow glow runs along the east like
the glare of a wind-blown fire.... Alas! I shall
not be among the fortunate mortals able to boast
of viewing from Fuji the first lifting of the sun!
Heavy clouds have drifted across the horizon at
the point where he should rise.... Now I know
that he has risen; because the upper edges of
those purple rags of cloud are burning like charcoal.
But I have been so disappointed!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p class="tbpara">More and more luminous the hollow world.
League-wide heapings of cottony cloud roll apart.
Fearfully far-away there is a light of gold upon
water: the sun here remains viewless, but the
ocean sees him. It is not a flicker, but a burnished
glow;&mdash;at such a distance ripplings are invisible....
Further and further scattering, the clouds
unveil a vast grey and blue landscape;&mdash;hundreds
and hundreds of miles throng into vision at
once. On the right I distinguish Tōkyō bay, and
Kamakura, and the holy island of Enoshima (no
bigger than the dot over this letter “i”);&mdash;on
the left the wilder Suruga coast, and the blue-toothed
promontory of Idzu, and the place of the
fishing-village where I have been summering,&mdash;the
merest pin-point in that tinted dream of
hill and shore. Rivers appear but as sun-gleams
on spider-threads;&mdash;fishing-sails are white dust
clinging to the grey-blue glass of the sea. And
the picture alternately appears and vanishes while
the clouds drift and shift across it, and shape
themselves into spectral islands and mountains
and valleys of all Elysian colors....</p>

<h4>VII</h4>

<p>6:40 <i>a. m.</i>&mdash;Start for the top.... Hardest
and roughest stage of the journey, through a wilderness
of lava-blocks. The path zigzags between
ugly masses that project from the slope
like black teeth. The trail of cast-away sandals
is wider than ever.... Have to rest every few
minutes.... Reach another long patch of the
snow that looks like glass-beads, and eat some.
The next station&mdash;a half-station&mdash;is closed;
and the ninth has ceased to exist.... A sudden
fear comes to me, not of the ascent, but of the
prospective descent by a route which is too steep
even to permit of comfortably sitting down. But
the guides assure me that there will be no difficulty,
and that most of the return-journey will
be by another way,&mdash;over the interminable level
which I wondered at yesterday,&mdash;nearly all soft
sand, with very few stones. It is called the
<i>hashiri</i> (“glissade”); and we are to descend at
a run!...</p>

<p>All at once a family of field-mice scatter out
from under my feet in panic; and the gōriki behind
me catches one, and gives it to me. I hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the tiny shivering life for a moment to examine
it, and set it free again. These little creatures
have very long pale noses. How do they live in
this waterless desolation,&mdash;and at such an altitude,&mdash;especially
in the season of snow? For
we are now at a height of more than eleven
thousand feet! The gōriki say that the mice
find roots growing under the stones....</p>

<p class="tbpara">Wilder and steeper;&mdash;for me, at least, the
climbing is sometimes on all fours. There are
barriers which we surmount with the help of
ladders. There are fearful places with Buddhist
names, such as the <i>Sai-no-Kawara</i>, or Dry Bed
of the River of Souls,&mdash;a black waste strewn
with heaps of rock, like those stone-piles which,
in Buddhist pictures of the underworld, the ghosts
of children build....</p>

<p class="tbpara">Twelve thousand feet, and something,&mdash;the
top! Time, 8:20 a. m.... Stone huts;
Shintō shrine with tōrii; icy well, called the
Spring of Gold; stone tablet bearing a Chinese
poem and the design of a tiger; rough walls of
lava-blocks round these things,&mdash;possibly for
protection against the wind. Then the huge
dead crater,&mdash;probably between a quarter of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
mile and half-a-mile wide, but shallowed up to
within three or four hundred feet of the verge by
volcanic detritus,&mdash;a cavity horrible even in the
tones of its yellow crumbling walls, streaked and
stained with every hue of scorching. I perceive
that the trail of straw sandals ends <i>in</i> the crater.
Some hideous over-hanging cusps of black lava&mdash;like
the broken edges of a monstrous cicatrix&mdash;project
on two sides several hundred feet above
the opening; but I certainly shall not take the
trouble to climb them. Yet these,&mdash;seen through
the haze of a hundred miles,&mdash;through the soft
illusion of blue spring-weather,&mdash;appear as the
opening snowy petals of the bud of the Sacred
Lotos!... No spot in this world can be more
horrible, more atrociously dismal, than the cindered
tip of the Lotos as you stand upon it.</p>

<p>But the view&mdash;the view for a hundred leagues,&mdash;and
the light of the far faint dreamy world,&mdash;and
the fairy vapors of morning,&mdash;and the
marvellous wreathings of cloud: all this, and
only this, consoles me for the labor and the
pain.... Other pilgrims, earlier climbers,&mdash;poised
upon the highest crag, with faces turned
to the tremendous East,&mdash;are clapping their
hands in Shintō prayer, saluting the mighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Day.... The immense poetry of the moment
enters into me with a thrill. I know that the
colossal vision before me has already become a
memory ineffaceable,&mdash;a memory of which no
luminous detail can fade till the hour when
thought itself must fade, and the dust of these
eyes be mingled with the dust of the myriad
million eyes that also have looked, in ages forgotten
before my birth, from the summit supreme
of Fuji to the Rising of the Sun.</p>

<p>“O insect, insect!&mdash;think you that Karma can be exhausted
by song?”&mdash;<i>Japanese poem.</i></p></div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>If you ever visit Japan, be sure to go to at least
one temple-festival,&mdash;<i>en-nichi</i>. The festival
ought to be seen at night, when everything
shows to the best advantage in the glow of
countless lamps and lanterns. Until you have
had this experience, you cannot know what Japan
is,&mdash;you cannot imagine the real charm of queerness
and prettiness, the wonderful blending of
grotesquery and beauty, to be found in the life
of the common people.</p>

<p>In such a night you will probably let yourself
drift awhile with the stream of sight-seers through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
dazzling lanes of booths full of toys indescribable&mdash;dainty
puerilities, fragile astonishments, laughter-making
oddities;&mdash;you will observe representations
of demons, gods, and goblins;&mdash;you will
be startled by <i>mandō</i>&mdash;immense lantern-transparencies,
with monstrous faces painted upon
them;&mdash;you will have glimpses of jugglers,
acrobats, sword-dancers, fortune-tellers;&mdash;you
will hear everywhere, above the tumult of voices,
a ceaseless blowing of flutes and booming of
drums. All this may not be worth stopping for.
But presently, I am almost sure, you will pause
in your promenade to look at a booth illuminated
like a magic-lantern, and stocked with tiny wooden
cages out of which an incomparable shrilling proceeds.
The booth is the booth of a vendor of
singing-insects; and the storm of noise is made
by the insects. The sight is curious; and a
foreigner is nearly always attracted by it.</p>

<p>But having satisfied his momentary curiosity,
the foreigner usually goes on his way with the idea
that he has been inspecting nothing more remarkable
than a particular variety of toys for children.
He might easily be made to understand that the
insect-trade of Tōkyō alone represents a yearly
value of thousands of dollars; but he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
certainly wonder if assured that the insects themselves
are esteemed for the peculiar character of
the sounds which they make. It would not be
easy to convince him that in the æsthetic life of a
most refined and artistic people, these insects hold
a place not less important or well-deserved than
that occupied in Western civilization by our
thrushes, linnets, nightingales and canaries. What
stranger could suppose that a literature one thousand
years old,&mdash;a literature full of curious and
delicate beauty,&mdash;exists upon the subject of these
short-lived insect-pets?</p>

<p class="tbpara">The object of the present paper is, by elucidating
these facts, to show how superficially our
travellers might unconsciously judge the most
interesting details of Japanese life. But such
misjudgments are as natural as they are inevitable.
Even with the kindest of intentions it
is impossible to estimate correctly at sight anything
of the extraordinary in Japanese custom,&mdash;because
the extraordinary nearly always relates
to feelings, beliefs, or thoughts about which a
stranger cannot know anything.</p>

<p class="tbpara">Before proceeding further, let me observe that
the domestic insects of which I am going to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
speak, are mostly night-singers, and must not
be confounded with the <i>semi</i> (cicadæ), mentioned
in former essays of mine. I think that the
cicadæ,&mdash;even in a country so exceptionally rich
as is Japan in musical insects,&mdash;are wonderful
melodists in their own way. But the Japanese
find as much difference between the notes of
night-insects and of cicadæ as we find between
those of larks and sparrows; and they relegate
their cicadæ to the vulgar place of chatterers.
<i>Semi</i> are therefore never caged. The national
liking for caged insects does not mean a liking
for mere noise; and the note of every insect
in public favor must possess either some rhythmic
charm, or some mimetic quality celebrated in
poetry or legend. The same fact is true of the
Japanese liking for the chant of frogs. It would
be a mistake to suppose that all kinds of frogs
are considered musical; but there are particular
species of very small frogs having sweet notes;
and these are caged and petted.</p>

<p>Of course, in the proper meaning of the word,
insects do not <i>sing</i>; but in the following pages
I may occasionally employ the terms “singer”
and “singing-insect,”&mdash;partly because of their
convenience, and partly because of their corre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>spondence
with the language used by Japanese
insect-dealers and poets, describing the “voices”
of such creatures.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>There are many curious references in the old
Japanese classic literature to the custom of keeping
musical insects. For example in the chapter
entitled <i>Nowaki</i><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of the famous novel “Genji
Monogatari,” written in the latter part of the
tenth century by the Lady Murasaki-Shikibu, it
is stated: “The maids were ordered to descend to
the garden, and give some water to the insects.”
But the first definite mention of cages for singing-insects
would appear to be the following passage
from a work entitled <i>Chomon-Shū</i>:&mdash;“On the
twelfth day of the eighth month of the second
year of Kaho [1095 <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span>], the Emperor ordered
his pages and chamberlains to go to Sagano and
find some insects. The Emperor gave them a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
cage of network of bright purple thread. All,
even the head-chaplain and his attendants, taking
horses from the Right and the Left Imperial
Mews, then went on horseback to hunt for
insects. Tokinori Ben, at that time holding the
office of <i>Kurando</i>,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> proposed to the party as they
rode toward Sagano, a subject for poetical composition.
The subject was, <i>Looking for insects
in the fields</i>. On reaching Sagano, the party
dismounted, and walked in various directions
for a distance of something more than ten <i>chō</i>,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
and sent their attendants to catch the insects.
In the evening they returned to the palace.
They put into the cage some <i>hagi</i><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and <i>ominameshi</i>
[for the insects]. The cage was respectfully
presented to the Empress. There was <i>saké</i>-drinking
in the palace that evening; and many
poems were composed. The Empress and her
court-ladies joined in the making of the poems.”</p>

<p class="tbpara">This would appear to be the oldest Japanese
record of an insect-hunt,&mdash;though the amuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>ment
may have been invented earlier than the
period of Kaho. By the seventeenth century
it seems to have become a popular diversion;
and night-hunts were in vogue as much as day-hunts.
In the <i>Teikoku Bunshū</i>, or collected works
of the poet Teikoku, who died during the second
year of Shōwō (1653), there has been preserved
one of the poet’s letters which contains a very
interesting passage on the subject. “Let us go
insect-hunting this evening,”&mdash;writes the poet to
his friend. “It is true that the night will be very
dark, since there is no moon; and it may seem
dangerous to go out. But there are many people
now going to the graveyards every night, because
the Bon festival is approaching<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>;&mdash;therefore the
way to the fields will not be lonesome for us. I
have prepared many lanterns;&mdash;so the <i>hata-ori</i>,
<i>matsumushi</i>, and other insects will probably come
to the lanterns in great number.”</p>

<p class="tbpara">It would also seem that the trade of insect-seller
(<i>mushiya</i>) existed in the seventeenth century;
for in a diary of that time, known as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the Diary of Kikaku, the writer speaks of his disappointment
at not finding any insect-dealers in
Yedo,&mdash;tolerably good evidence that he had met
such persons elsewhere. “On the thirteenth day
of the sixth month of the fourth year of Teikyo
[1687], I went out,” he writes, “to look for
<i>kirigirisu</i>-sellers. I searched for them in Yotsuya,
in Kōjimachi, in Hongō, in Yushimasa, and
in both divisions of Kanda-Sudamachō<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>; but I
found none.”</p>

<p>As we shall presently see, the <i>kirigirisu</i> was
not sold in Tōkyō until about one hundred and
twenty years later.</p>

<p class="tbpara">But long before it became the fashion to keep
singing-insects, their music had been celebrated
by poets as one of the æsthetic pleasures of
the autumn. There are charming references to
singing-insects in poetical collections made during
the tenth century, and doubtless containing
many compositions of a yet earlier period. And
just as places famous for cherry, plum, or other
blossoming trees, are still regularly visited every
year by thousands and tens of thousands, merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
for the delight of seeing the flowers in their seasons,&mdash;so
in ancient times city-dwellers made
autumn excursions to country-districts simply for
the pleasure of hearing the chirruping choruses
of crickets and of locusts,&mdash;the night-singers
especially. Centuries ago places were noted as
pleasure-resorts solely because of this melodious
attraction;&mdash;such were Musashino (now Tōkyō),
Yatano in the province of Echizen, and Mano in
the province of Ōmi. Somewhat later, probably,
people discovered that each of the principal species
of singing-insects haunted by preference some particular
locality, where its peculiar chanting could
be heard to the best advantage; and eventually
no less than eleven places became famous throughout
Japan for different kinds of insect-music.</p>

<p>The best places to hear the <i>matsumushi</i>
were:&mdash;</p>

<p>
(1) Arashiyama, near Kyōto, in the province of Yamashiro;<br />
(2) Sumiyoshi, in the province of Settsu;<br />
(3) Miyagino, in the province of Mutsu.<br />
</p>

<p>The best places to hear the <i>suzumushi</i> were:&mdash;</p>

<p>
(4) Kagura-ga-Oka, in Yamashiro;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>(5) Ogura-yama, in Yamashiro;<br />
(6) Suzuka-yama, in Isé;<br />
(7) Narumi, in Owari.<br />
</p>

<p>The best places to hear the <i>kirigirisu</i> were:&mdash;</p>

<p>
(8) Sagano, in Yamashiro;<br />
(9) Takeda-no-Sato, in Yamashiro;<br />
(10) Tatsuta-yama, in Yamato;<br />
(11) Ono-no-Shinowara, in Ōmi.<br />
</p>

<p class="tbpara">Afterwards, when the breeding and sale of
singing-insects became a lucrative industry, the
custom of going into the country to hear them
gradually went out of fashion. But even to-day
city-dwellers, when giving a party, will sometimes
place cages of singing-insects among the garden-shrubbery,
so that the guests may enjoy not only
the music of the little creatures, but also those
memories or sensations of rural peace which such
music evokes.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>The regular trade in musical insects is of
comparatively modern origin. In Tōkyō its
beginnings date back only to the Kwansei era
(1789-1800),&mdash;at which period, however, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
capital of the Shōgunate was still called Yedo.
A complete history of the business was recently
placed in my hands,&mdash;a history partly compiled
from old documents, and partly from traditions
preserved in the families of several noted insect-merchants
of the present day.</p>

<p class="tbpara">The founder of the Tōkyō trade was an itinerant
foodseller named Chūzō, originally from
Echigo, who settled in the Kanda district of the
city in the latter part of the eighteenth century.
One day, while making his usual rounds, it occurred
to him to capture a few of the <i>suzumushi</i>,
or bell-insects, then very plentiful in the Negishi
quarter, and to try the experiment of feeding
them at home. They throve and made music in
confinement; and several of Chūzō’s neighbors,
charmed by their melodious chirruping, asked to
be supplied with <i>suzumushi</i> for a consideration.
From this accidental beginning, the demand for
<i>suzumushi</i> grew rapidly to such proportions that
the foodseller at last decided to give up his
former calling and to become an insect-seller.</p>

<p>Chūzō only caught and sold insects: he never
imagined that it would be more profitable to
breed them. But the fact was presently discov<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>ered
by one of his customers,&mdash;a man named
Kirayama, then in the service of the Lord
Aoyama Shimodzuké-no-Kami. Kiriyama had
bought from Chūzō several <i>suzumushi</i>, which
were kept and fed in a jar half-filled with moist
clay. They died in the cold season; but during
the following summer Kiriyama was agreeably
surprised to find the jar newly peopled with a
number of young ones, evidently born from eggs
which the first prisoners had left in the clay. He
fed them carefully, and soon had the pleasure,
my chronicler says, of hearing them “begin to
sing in small voices.” Then he resolved to make
some experiments; and, aided by Chūzō, who
furnished the males and females, he succeeded in
breeding not only <i>suzumushi</i>, but three other
kinds of singing-insects also,&mdash;<i>kantan</i>, <i>matsumushi</i>,
and <i>kutsuwamushi</i>. He discovered, at the
same time, that, by keeping his jars in a warm
room, the insects could be hatched considerably
in advance of the natural season. Chūzō sold
for Kiriyama these home-bred singers; and both
men found the new undertaking profitable beyond
expectation.</p>

<p>The example set by Kiriyama was imitated by
a <i>tabiya</i>, or stocking-maker named Yasubei (com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>monly
known as Tabiya Yasubei by reason of his
calling), who lived in Kanda-ku. Yasubei likewise
made careful study of the habits of singing-insects,
with a view to their breeding and nourishment;
and he soon found himself able to carry
on a small trade in them. Up to that time the
insects sold in Yedo would seem to have been
kept in jars or boxes: Yasubei conceived the
idea of having special cages manufactured for
them. A man named Kondō, vassal to the Lord
Kamei of Honjō-ku, interested himself in the
matter, and made a number of pretty little cages
which delighted Yasubei, and secured a large
order from him. The new invention found public
favor at once; and Kondō soon afterwards
established the first manufactory of insect-cages.</p>

<div class="figcenter nobreak" style="width: 500px;">
<a href="images/zillt050ah.jpg">
<img class="border" src="images/zillt050a.jpg" width="500" height="227" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption">1. <span class="smcap">A Form of Insect Cage.</span> 2. <span class="smcap">Cage for Large Musical Insects</span>,&mdash;<i>Kirigirisu, Kutsuwamushi, etc.</i><br /> 3. <span class="smcap">Cage for Small Musical Insects, or Fire-Flies</span></div>
</div>

<p>The demand for singing-insects increased from
this time so rapidly, that Chūzō soon found it
impossible to supply all his would-be customers
directly. He therefore decided to change his
business to wholesale trade, and to sell to retail
dealers only. To meet orders, he purchased
largely from peasants in the suburbs and elsewhere.
Many persons were employed by him;
and Yasubei and others paid him a fixed annual
sum for sundry rights and privileges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Some time after this Yasubei became the first
itinerant-vendor of singing-insects. He walked
through the streets crying his wares; but hired a
number of servants to carry the cages. Tradition
says that while going his rounds he used to wear
a <i>katabira</i><a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> made of a much-esteemed silk stuff
called <i>sukiya</i>, together with a fine Hakata-girdle;
and that this elegant way of dressing proved of
much service to him in his business.</p>

<p>Two men, whose names have been preserved,
soon entered into competition with Yasubei.
The first was Yasakura Yasuzō, of Honjō-ku, by
previous occupation a <i>sahainin</i>, or property-agent.
He prospered, and became widely known
as Mushi-Yasu,&mdash;“Yasu-the-Insect-Man.” His
success encouraged a former fellow-<i>sahainin</i>,
Genbei of Uyeno, to go into the same trade.
Genbei likewise found insect-selling a lucrative
occupation, and earned for himself the sobriquet
of Mushi-Gen, by which he is yet remembered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
His descendants in Tōkyō to-day are <i>amé</i><a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>-manufacturers;
but they still carry on the hereditary
insect-business during the summer and autumn
months; and one of the firm was kind enough
to furnish me with many of the facts recorded in
this little essay.</p>

<p>Chūzō, the father and founder of all this curious
commerce, died without children; and sometime
in the period of Bunsei (1818-1829) his business
was taken over by a distant relative named Yamasaki
Seïchirō. To Chūzō’s business, Yamasaki
joined his own,&mdash;that of a toy-merchant. About
the same time a law was passed limiting the
number of insect-dealers in the municipality to
thirty-six. The thirty-six then formed themselves
into a guild, called the Ōyama-Kō (“Ōyama
Society”), having for patron the divinity
Sekison-Sama of the mountain Ōyama in Sagami
Province.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> But in business the association<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
was known as the Yedō-Mushi-Kō, or Yedo
Insect-Company.</p>

<p>It is not until after this consolidation of the
trade that we hear of the <i>kirigirisu</i>,&mdash;the same
musical insect which the poet Kikaku had vainly
tried to buy in the city in 1687,&mdash;being sold
in Yedo. One of the guild known as Mushiya
Kojirō (“Kojirō the Insect-Merchant”), who did
business in Honjō-Ku, returning to the city after
a short visit to his native place in Kadzusa,
brought back with him a number of <i>kirigirisu</i>,
which he sold at a good profit. Although long
famous elsewhere, these insects had never before
been sold in Yedo.</p>

<p>“When Midzu Echizen-no-Kami,” says the
chronicle, “became <i>machi-bugyō</i> (or chief magistrate)
of Yedo, the law limiting the number
of insect-dealers to thirty-six, was abolished.”
Whether the guild was subsequently dissolved
the chronicle fails to mention.</p>

<p>Kiriyama, the first to breed singing-insects artificially,
had, like Chūzō, built up a prosperous
trade. He left a son, Kaméjirō, who was adopted
into the family of one Yumoto, living in Waséda,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Ushigomé-ku. Kaméjirō brought with him to the
Yumoto family the valuable secrets of his father’s
occupation; and the Yumoto family is still celebrated
in the business of insect breeding.</p>

<p>To-day the greatest insect-merchant in Tōkyō
is said to be Kawasumi Kanésaburō, of Samon-chō
in Yotsuya-ku. A majority of the lesser
dealers obtain their autumn stock from him. But
the insects bred artificially, and sold in summer,
are mostly furnished by the Yumoto house. Other
noted dealers are Mushi-Sei, of Shitaya-ku, and
Mushi-Toku, of Asakusa. These buy insects
caught in the country, and brought to the city by
the peasants. The wholesale dealers supply both
insects and cages to multitudes of itinerant vendors
who do business in the neighborhood of the parish-temples
during the <i>en-nichi</i>, or religious festivals,&mdash;especially
after dark. Almost every night of
the year there are <i>en-nichi</i> in some quarter of the
capital; and the insect-sellers are rarely idle during

<p>These prices, however, rule only during the
busy period of the insect trade. In May and the
latter part of June the prices are high,&mdash;for only
artificially bred insects are then in the market. In
July <i>kirigirisu</i> brought from the country will
sell as low as one sen. The <i>kantan</i>, <i>kusa-hibari</i>,
and <i>Yamato-suzu</i> sell sometimes as low as two
sen. In August the <i>Emma-kōrogi</i> can be bought
even at the rate of ten for one sen; and in September
the <i>kuro-hibari</i>, <i>kanétataki</i>, and <i>umaoi</i>
sell for one or one and a half sen each. But
there is little variation at any season in the prices
of <i>suzumushi</i> and of <i>matsumushi</i>. These are
never very dear, but never sell at less than three
sen; and there is always a demand for them. The
<i>suzumushi</i> is the most popular of all; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
greater part of the profits annually made in the
insect-trade is said to be gained on the sale of
this insect.</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>As will be seen from the foregoing price-list,
twelve varieties of musical insects are sold in
Tōkyō. Nine can be artificially bred,&mdash;namely
the <i>suzumushi</i>, <i>matsumushi</i>, <i>kirigirisu</i>, <i>kantan</i>,
<i>kutsuwamushi</i>, <i>Emma-kōrogi</i>, <i>kin-hibari</i>, <i>kusa-hibari</i>
(also called <i>Asa-suzu</i>), and the <i>Yamato-suzu</i>,
or <i>Yoshino-suzu</i>. Three varieties, I am
told, are not bred for sale, but captured for the
market: these are the <i>kanétataki</i>, <i>umaoi</i> or
<i>hataori</i>, and <i>kuro-hibari</i>. But a considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
number of all the insects annually offered for
sale, are caught in their native haunts.</p>

<div class="figcenter nobreak" style="width: 500px;">
<a href="images/zillt057h.png">
<img src="images/zillt057.png" width="500" height="324" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Kanétataki</span> (“<span class="smcap">The Bell-Ringer</span>”) (<i>natural size</i>).</div>
</div>

<p>The night-singers are, with few exceptions,
easily taken. They are captured with the help of
lanterns. Being quickly attracted by light, they
approach the lanterns; and when near enough to
be observed, they can readily be covered with nets
or little baskets. Males and females are usually
secured at the same time, for the creatures move
about in couples. Only the males sing; but a
certain number of females are always taken for
breeding purposes. Males and females are kept
in the same vessel only for breeding: they are
never left together in a cage, because the male
ceases to sing when thus mated, and will die in a
short time after pairing.</p>

<p>The breeding pairs are kept in jars or other
earthen vessels half-filled with moistened clay,
and are supplied every day with fresh food.
They do not live long: the male dies first, and
the female survives only until her eggs have been
laid. The young insects hatched from them, shed
their skin in about forty days from birth, after
which they grow more rapidly, and soon attain
their full development. In their natural state
these creatures are hatched a little before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Doyō, or Period of Greatest Heat by the old
calendar,&mdash;that is to say, about the middle
of July;&mdash;and they begin to sing in October.
But when bred in a warm room, they are hatched
early in April; and, with careful feeding, they
can be offered for sale before the end of May.
When very young, their food is triturated and
spread for them upon a smooth piece of wood;
but the adults are usually furnished with unprepared
food,&mdash;consisting of parings of egg-plant,
melon-rind, cucumber-rind, or the soft interior
parts of the white onion. Some insects, however,
are specially nourished;&mdash;the <i>abura-kirigirisu</i>,
for example, being fed with sugar-water and
slices of musk-melon.</p>


<h4>V</h4>

<p>All the insects mentioned in the Tōkyō price-list
are not of equal interest; and several of the
names appear to refer only to different varieties
of one species,&mdash;though on this point I am not
positive. Some of the insects do not seem to
have yet been scientifically classed; and I am
no entomologist. But I can offer some general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
notes on the more important among the little
melodists, and free translations of a few out of
the countless poems about them,&mdash;beginning
with the <i>matsumushi</i>, which was celebrated in
Japanese verse a thousand years ago:</p>


<h5><i>Matsumushi.</i><a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></h5>

<p>As ideographically written, the name of this
creature signifies “pine-insect;” but, as pronounced,
it might mean also “waiting-insect,”&mdash;since
the verb “<i>matsu</i>,”
“to wait,” and the noun
“<i>matsu</i>,” “pine,” have
the same sound. It is
chiefly upon this double
meaning of the word as
uttered that a host of
Japanese poems about
the <i>matsumushi</i> are based. Some of these
are very old,&mdash;dating back to the tenth century
at least.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 298px;">
<a href="images/zillt060h.png">
<img src="images/zillt060.png" width="298" height="301" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Matsumushi</span> (<i>slightly enlarged</i>).</div>
</div>

<p>Although by no means a rare insect, the matsumushi
is much esteemed for the peculiar clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>ness
and sweetness of its notes&mdash;(onomatopoetically
rendered in Japanese by the syllables
<i>chin-chirorīn, chin-chirorīn</i>),&mdash;little silvery
shrillings which I can best describe as resembling
the sound of an electric bell heard from a distance.
The matsumushi haunts pine-woods and
cryptomeria-groves, and makes its music at night.
It is a very small insect, with a dark-brown back,
and a yellowish belly.</p>

<p class="tbpara">Perhaps the oldest extant verses upon the
matsumushi are those contained in the <i>Kokinshū</i>,&mdash;a
famous anthology compiled in the year 905
by the court-poet Tsurayuki and several of his
noble friends. Here we first find that play on
the name of the insect as pronounced, which was
to be repeated in a thousand different keys by a
multitude of poets through the literature of more
than nine hundred years:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">

<p>“In the autumn-fields I lose my way;&mdash;perhaps
I might ask for lodging in the direction of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
cry of the waiting-insect;”&mdash;that is to say,
“might sleep to-night in the grass where the
insects are waiting for me.” There is in the
same work a much prettier poem on the matsumushi
by Tsurayuki.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With dusk begins to cry the male of the Waiting-insect;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, too, await my beloved, and, hearing, my longing grows.<br /></span>

<p>The following poems on the same insect are
less ancient but not less interesting:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Forever past and gone, the hour of the promised advent!&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The Waiting-insect’s voice;&mdash;and I that wait in the garden,<br /></span>

</div></div>


<h5><i>Suzumushi.</i><a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></h5>

<p>The name signifies “bell-insect;” but the bell
of which the sound is thus referred to is a very
small bell, or a bunch of little bells such as a
Shinto priestess uses in the sacred dances. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
<i>suzumushi</i> is a great favorite with insect-fanciers,
and is bred in great numbers for the market. In
the wild state it is found in many parts of Japan;
and at night the noise made by multitudes of
<i>suzumushi</i> in certain lonesome places might easily
be mistaken,&mdash;as
it has been by
myself more than
once,&mdash;for the
sound of rapids.
The Japanese description
of the insect as resembling
“a watermelon seed”&mdash;the black kind&mdash;is
excellent. It is very small, with a black back,
and a white or yellowish belly. Its tintinnabulation&mdash;<i>ri-ï-ï-ï-in</i>,
as the Japanese render the
sound&mdash;might easily be mistaken for the tinkling
of a <i>suzu</i>. Both the <i>matsumushi</i> and the
<i>suzumushi</i> are mentioned in Japanese poems of
the period of Engi (901-922).</p>

</div></div>


<h5><i>Hataori-mushi.</i></h5>

<p>The <i>hataori</i> is a beautiful bright-green grasshopper,
of very graceful shape. Two reasons
are given for its curious name, which signifies
“the Weaver.” One is that, when held in a
particular way, the struggling gestures of the
creature resemble the movements of a girl weaving.
The other reason is that its music seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
imitate the sound of the reed and shuttle of a
hand-loom in operation,&mdash;<i>Ji-ï-ï-ï&mdash;chon-chon!&mdash;ji-ï-ï-ï&mdash;chon-chon!</i></p>

<p class="tbpara">There is a pretty folk-story about the origin
of the <i>hataori</i> and the <i>kirigirisu</i>, which used to
be told to Japanese children in former times.&mdash;Long,
long ago, says the tale, there were two
very dutiful daughters who supported their old
blind father by the labor of their hands. The
elder girl used to weave, and the younger to sew.
When the old blind father died at last, these good
girls grieved so much that they soon died also.
One beautiful morning, some creatures of a kind
never seen before were found making music
above the graves of the sisters. On the tomb
of the elder was a pretty green insect, producing
sounds like those made by a girl weaving,&mdash;<i>ji-ï-ï-ï,
chon-chon! ji-ï-ï-ï, chon-chon!</i> This
was the first <i>hataori-mushi</i>. On the tomb of
the younger sister was an insect which kept crying
out, “<i>Tsuzuré&mdash;sasé, sasé!&mdash;tsuzuré, tsuzuré&mdash;sasé,
sasé, sasé!</i>” (Torn clothes&mdash;patch,
patch them up!&mdash;torn clothes, torn clothes&mdash;patch
up, patch up, patch up!) This was the
first <i>kirigirisu</i>. Then everybody knew that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
spirits of the good sisters had taken those shapes.
Still every autumn they cry to wives and daughters
to work well at the loom, and warn them to
repair the winter garments of the household
before the coming of the cold.</p>

<p class="tbpara">Such poems as I have been able to obtain about
the <i>hataori</i> consist of nothing more than pretty
fancies. Two, of which I offer free renderings,
are ancient,&mdash;the first by Tsurayuki; the second
by a poetess classically known as “Akinaka’s
Daughter”:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Weaving-insects I hear; and the fields, in their autumn-colors,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seem of Chinese-brocade:&mdash;was this the weavers’ work?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Gossamer-threads are spread over the shrubs and grasses:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weaving-insects I hear;&mdash;do they weave with spider-silk?<br /></span>
</div></div>


<h5><i>Umaoi.</i></h5>

<p>The <i>umaoi</i> is sometimes confounded with the
<i>hataori</i>, which it much resembles. But the true
umaoi&mdash;(called <i>junta</i> in Izumo)&mdash;is a shorter
and thicker insect than the <i>hataori</i>; and has at
its tail a hook-shaped protuberance, which the
weaver-insect has not. Moreover, there is some
difference in the sounds made by the two creatures.
The music of the umaoi is not “<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span><i>ji-ï-ï-ï,&mdash;chon-chon</i>,”
but, “<i>zu-ï-in-tzō!&mdash;zu-ï-in-tzō!</i>”&mdash;say
the Japanese.</p>

<h5><i>Kirigirisu.</i><a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></h5>

<p>There are different varieties of this much-prized
insect. The <i>abura-kirigirisu</i>, a day-singer, is a
delicate creature, and must be carefully nourished
in confinement. The <i>tachi-kirigirisu</i>, a night-singer,
is more commonly found in the market.
Captured <i>kirigirisu</i> sold in Tōkyō are mostly
from the neighborhood of Itabashi, Niiso, and
Todogawa; and these, which fetch high prices,
are considered the best. They are large vigorous
insects, uttering very clear notes. From Kujiukuri
in Kadzusa other and much cheaper <i>kirigirisu</i>
are brought to the capital; but these have a disagreeable
odor, suffer from the attacks of a
peculiar parasite, and are feeble musicians.</p>

<div class="figcenter nobreak" style="width: 500px;">

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>
<p>As stated elsewhere, the sounds made by the
kirigirisu are said to resemble those of the Japanese
words, “<i>Tsuzuré&mdash;sasé! sasé!</i>” (Torn
clothes&mdash;patch up! patch up!); and a large proportion
of the many poems written about the
insect depend for interest upon ingenious but
untranslatable allusions to those words. I offer
renderings therefore of only two poems on the
<i>kirigirisu</i>,&mdash;the first by an unknown poet in the
<i>Kokinshū</i>; the second by Tadafusa:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

of the well-known Shino-bazu-no-iké,&mdash;the
great lotos-pond
of Uyeno in Tōkyō;&mdash;but
of late years it has become

One variety, the <i>ebi-kōrogi</i>, or “shrimp-kōrogi,”
does not make any sound. But the
<i>uma-kōrogi</i>, or “horse-kōrogi;” the
<i>Oni-kōrogi</i>, or “Demon-kōrogi;”
and the <i>Emma-kōrogi</i>, or “Cricket-of-Emma<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
[King of the Dead],”
are all good musicians. The
color is blackish-brown, or
black;&mdash;the best singing-varieties have curious
wavy markings on the wings.</p>

<p>An interesting fact regarding the <i>kōrogi</i> is that

<h5><i>Kutsuwamushi.</i></h5>

<p>There are several varieties of this extraordinary
creature,&mdash;also called onomatopoetically <i>gatcha-gatcha</i>,&mdash;which
is most provokingly described in
dictionaries as “a kind of noisy cricket”! The
variety commonly sold in Tōkyō has a green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
back, and a yellowish-white abdomen; but there
are also brown and reddish varieties. The <i>kutsuwamushi</i>
is difficult to capture, but easy to
breed. As the <i>tsuku-tsuku-bōshi</i> is the most
wonderful musician among the sun-loving cicadæ
or <i>semi</i>, so the <i>kutsuwamushi</i> is the most wonderful
of night-crickets. It owes its name, which
means “The Bridle-bit-Insect,” to its noise, which
resembles the jingling and ringing of the old-fashioned
Japanese bridle-bit (<i>kutsuwa</i>). But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the sound is really much louder and much more
complicated than ever was the jingling of a single
<i>kutsuwa</i>; and the accuracy of the comparison is
not easily discerned while the creature is storming
beside you. Without the evidence of one’s own
eyes, it were hard to believe that so small a life
could make so prodigious a noise. Certainly
the vibratory apparatus in this insect must be very
complicated. The sound begins with a thin sharp
whizzing, as of leaking steam, and slowly strengthens;&mdash;then
to the whizzing is suddenly added
a quick dry clatter, as of castanets;&mdash;and then,
as the whole machinery rushes into operation,
you hear, high above the whizzing and the clatter,
a torrent of rapid ringing tones like the tapping
of a gong. These, the last to begin, are also the
first to cease; then the castanets stop; and finally
the whizzing dies;&mdash;but the full orchestra may
remain in operation for several hours at a time,
without a pause. Heard from far away at night
the sound is pleasant, and is really so much like
the ringing of a bridle-bit, that when you first
listen to it you cannot but feel how much real
poetry belongs to the name of this insect,&mdash;celebrated
from of old as “playing at ghostly escort
in ways where no man can pass.”</p>

<h5><i>Kantan.</i></h5>

<p>This insect&mdash;also called <i>kantan-gisu</i>, and
<i>kantan-no-kirigirisu</i>,&mdash;is a dark-brown night-cricket.
Its note&mdash;“<i>zi-ï-ï-ï-in</i>” is peculiar:
I can only compare it to the prolonged twang of
a bow-string. But this comparison is not satisfactory,
because there is a penetrant metallic quality
in the twang, impossible to describe.</p>

<h4>VI</h4>

<p>Besides poems about the chanting of particular
insects, there are countless Japanese poems, ancient
and modern, upon the voices of night-insects in
general,&mdash;chiefly in relation to the autumn season.
Out of a multitude I have selected and
translated a few of the more famous only, as
typical of the sentiment or fancy of hundreds.
Although some of my renderings are far from
literal as to language, I believe that they express
with tolerable faithfulness the thought and feeling
of the originals:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Not for my sake alone, I know, is the autumn’s coming;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, hearing the insects sing, at once my heart grows sad.<br /></span>

</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Faint in the moonshine sounds the chorus of insect-voices:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To-night the sadness of autumn speaks in their plaintive tone.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I never can find repose in the chilly nights of autumn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because of the pain I hear in the insects’ plaintive song.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How must it be in the fields where the dews are falling thickly!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Should I tread upon insect-voices<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>&mdash;what would my feelings be!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The song is ever the same, but the tones of the insects differ,<br /></span>

<span class="sig"><span class="smcap">Idzumi-Shikibu.</span><br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">These trembling dews on the grass&mdash;are they tears for the death of autumn?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tears of the insect-singers that now so sadly cry?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It might be thought that several of the poems
above given were intended to express either a real
or an affected sympathy with imagined insect-pain.
But this would be a wrong interpretation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
In most compositions of this class, the artistic
purpose is to suggest, by indirect means, various
phases of the emotion of love,&mdash;especially that
melancholy which lends its own passional tone to
the aspects and the voices of nature. The baroque
fancy that dew might be insect-tears, is by its
very exaggeration intended to indicate the extravagance
of grief, as well as to suggest that human
tears have been freshly shed. The verses in which
a woman declares that her heart has become too
affectionate, since she cannot but feel for the bell-insect
during a heavy shower, really bespeak the
fond anxiety felt for some absent beloved, travelling
in the time of the great rains. Again, in the
lines about “treading on insect-voices,” the dainty
scruple is uttered only as a hint of that intensification
of feminine tenderness which love creates.
And a still more remarkable example of this indirect
double-suggestiveness is offered by the little
poem prefacing this article,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“O insect, insect!&mdash;think you that Karma can be exhausted by song?”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Western reader would probably suppose that
the insect-condition, or insect-state-of-being, is
here referred to; but the real thought of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
speaker, presumably a woman, is that her own
sorrow is the result of faults committed in former
lives, and is therefore impossible to alleviate.</p>

<p>It will have been observed that a majority of
the verses cited refer to autumn and to the sensations
of autumn. Certainly Japanese poets
have not been insensible to the real melancholy
inspired by autumn,&mdash;that vague strange annual
revival of ancestral pain: dim inherited sorrow
of millions of memories associated through millions
of years with the death of summer;&mdash;but
in nearly every utterance of this melancholy, the
veritable allusion is to grief of parting. With its
color-changes, its leaf-whirlings, and the ghostly
plaint of its insect-voices, autumn Buddhistically
symbolizes impermanency, the certainty of bereavement,
the pain that clings to all desire, and
the sadness of isolation.</p>

<p class="tbpara">But even if these poems on insects were primarily
intended to shadow amorous emotion, do
they not reflect also for us the subtlest influences
of nature,&mdash;wild pure nature,&mdash;upon imagination
and memory? Does not the place accorded
to insect-melody, in the home-life as well as in
the literature of Japan, prove an æsthetic sensi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>bility
developed in directions that yet remain for
us almost unexplored? Does not the shrilling
booth of the insect-seller at a night-festival proclaim
even a popular and universal comprehension
of things divined in the West only by our
rarest poets:&mdash;the pleasure-pain of autumn’s
beauty, the weird sweetness of the voices of the
night, the magical quickening of remembrance by
echoes of forest and field? Surely we have
something to learn from the people in whose
mind the simple chant of a cricket can awaken
whole fairy-swarms of tender and delicate fancies.
We may boast of being their masters in the
mechanical,&mdash;their teachers of the artificial in all
its varieties of ugliness;&mdash;but in the knowledge
of the natural,&mdash;in the feeling of the joy and
beauty of earth,&mdash;they exceed us like the Greeks
of old. Yet perhaps it will be only when our
blind aggressive industrialism has wasted and
sterilized their paradise,&mdash;substituting everywhere
for beauty the utilitarian, the conventional,
the vulgar, the utterly hideous,&mdash;that we shall
begin with remorseful amazement to comprehend
the charm of that which we destroyed.</p>

<h3>A Question in the Zen Texts</h3>

<div class="figcenter nobreak" style="width: 46px;">
<img src="images/zillchapterheading.png" width="46" height="50" alt="decoration" />
</div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>My friend opened a thin yellow volume of
that marvellous text which proclaims at
sight the patience of the Buddhist engraver.
Movable Chinese types may be very
useful; but the best of which they are capable
is ugliness itself when compared with the beauty
of the old block-printing.</p>

<p>“I have a queer story for you,” he said.</p>

<p>“A Japanese story?”</p>

<p>“No,&mdash;Chinese.”</p>

<p>“What is the book?”</p>

<p>“According to Japanese pronunciation of the
Chinese characters of the title, we call it <i>Mu-Mon-Kwan</i>,
which means ‘The Gateless Barrier.’
It is one of the books especially studied by the
Zen sect, or sect of Dhyâna. A peculiarity of
some of the Dhyâna texts,&mdash;this being a good
example,&mdash;is that they are not explanatory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
They only suggest. Questions are put; but the
student must think out the answers for himself.
He must <i>think</i> them out, but not write them.
You know that Dhyâna represents human effort
to reach, through meditation, zones of thought
beyond the range of verbal expression; and any
thought once narrowed into utterance loses all
Dhyâna quality.... Well, this story is supposed
to be true; but it is used only for a Dhyâna
question. There are three different Chinese versions
of it; and I can give you the substance of
the three.”</p>

<p>Which he did as follows:&mdash;</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>&mdash;<i>The story of the girl Ts’ing, which is told
in the Lui-shwo-li-hwan-ki, cited by the Ching-tang-luh,
and commented upon in the Wu-mu-kwan
(called by the Japanese Mu-Mon-Kwan),
which is a book of the Zen sect:</i>&mdash;</p>

<p class="tbpara">There lived in Han-yang a man called Chang-Kien,
whose child-daughter, Ts’ing, was of peerless
beauty. He had also a nephew called
Wang-Chau,&mdash;a very handsome boy. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
children played together, and were fond of each
other. Once Kien jestingly said to his nephew:&mdash;“Some
day I will marry you to my little
daughter.” Both children remembered these
words; and they believed themselves thus betrothed.</p>

<p>When Ts’ing grew up, a man of rank asked for
her in marriage; and her father decided to comply
with the demand. Ts’ing was greatly troubled
by this decision. As for Chau, he was so much
angered and grieved that he resolved to leave
home, and go to another province. The next
day he got a boat ready for his journey, and
after sunset, without bidding farewell to any one,
he proceeded up the river. But in the middle of
the night he was startled by a voice calling to
him, “Wait!&mdash;it is I!”&mdash;and he saw a girl
running along the bank towards the boat. It was
Ts’ing. Chau was unspeakably delighted. She
sprang into the boat; and the lovers found their
way safely to the province of Chuh.</p>

<p>In the province of Chuh they lived happily
for six years; and they had two children. But
Ts’ing could not forget her parents, and often
longed to see them again. At last she said to
her husband:&mdash;“Because in former time I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
not bear to break the promise made to you, I ran
away with you and forsook my parents,&mdash;although
knowing that I owed them all possible
duty and affection. Would it not now be well
to try to obtain their forgiveness?” “Do not
grieve yourself about that,” said Chau;&mdash;“we
shall go to see them.” He ordered a boat to be
prepared; and a few days later he returned with
his wife to Han-yang.</p>

<p>According to custom in such cases, the husband
first went to the house of Kien, leaving Ts’ing
alone in the boat. Kien, welcomed his nephew
with every sign of joy, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“How much I have been longing to see you!
I was often afraid that something had happened
to you.”</p>

<p>Chau answered respectfully:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I am distressed by the undeserved kindness of
your words. It is to beg your forgiveness that
I have come.”</p>

<p>But Kien did not seem to understand. He
asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>“To what matter do you refer?”</p>

<p>“I feared,” said Chau, “that you were angry
with me for having run away with Ts’ing. I took
her with me to the province of Chuh.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>“What Ts’ing was that?” asked Kien.</p>

<p>“Your daughter Ts’ing,” answered Chau, beginning
to suspect his father-in-law of some
malevolent design.</p>

<p>“What are you talking about?” cried Kien,
with every appearance of astonishment. “My
daughter Ts’ing has been sick in bed all these
years,&mdash;ever since the time when you went
away.”</p>

<p>“Your daughter Ts’ing,” returned Chau, becoming
angry, “has not been sick. She has
been my wife for six years; and we have two
children; and we have both returned to this
place only to seek your pardon. Therefore please
do not mock us!”</p>

<p>For a moment the two looked at each other in
silence. Then Kien arose, and motioning to his
nephew to follow, led the way to an inner room
where a sick girl was lying. And Chau, to his
utter amazement, saw the face of Ts’ing,&mdash;beautiful,
but strangely thin and pale.</p>

<p>“She cannot speak,” explained the old man;
“but she can understand.” And Kien said to
her, laughingly:&mdash;“Chau tells me that you ran
away with him, and that you gave him two
children.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>The sick girl looked at Chau, and smiled; but
remained silent.</p>

<p>“Now come with me to the river,” said the
bewildered visitor to his father-in-law. “For I
can assure you,&mdash;in spite of what I have seen in
this house,&mdash;that your daughter Ts’ing is at this
moment in my boat.”</p>

<p>They went to the river; and there, indeed,
was the young wife, waiting. And seeing her
father, she bowed down before him, and besought
his pardon.</p>

<p>Kien said to her:&mdash;</p>

<p>“If you really be my daughter, I have nothing
but love for you. Yet though you seem to be
my daughter, there is something which I cannot
understand.... Come with us to the house.”</p>

<p>So the three proceeded toward the house. As
they neared it, they saw that the sick girl,&mdash;who
had not before left her bed for years,&mdash;was
coming to meet them, smiling as if much delighted.
And the two Ts’ings approached each
other. But then&mdash;nobody could ever tell how&mdash;they
suddenly melted into each other, and became
one body, one person, one Ts’ing,&mdash;even
more beautiful than before, and showing no sign
of sickness or of sorrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Kien said to Chau:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Ever since the day of your going, my
daughter was dumb, and most of the time like a
person who had taken too much wine. Now I
know that her spirit was absent.”</p>

<p>Ts’ing herself said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Really I never knew that I was at home. I
saw Chau going away in silent anger; and the
same night I dreamed that I ran after his boat....
But now I cannot tell which was really I,&mdash;the
I that went away in the boat, or the I that
stayed at home.”</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>“That is the whole of the story,” my friend
observed. “Now there is a note about it in the
<i>Mu-Mon-Kwan</i> that may interest you. This
note says:&mdash;‘The fifth patriarch of the Zen sect
once asked a priest,&mdash;”<i>In the case of the separation
of the spirit of the girl Ts’ing, which was
the true Ts’ing?</i>”’ It was only because of this
question that the story was cited in the book.
But the question is not answered. The author
only remarks:&mdash;‘If you can decide which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the real Ts’ing, then you will have learned that
to go out of one envelope and into another is
merely like putting up at an inn. But if you
have not yet reached this degree of enlightenment,
take heed that you do not wander aimlessly
about the world. Otherwise, when Earth,
Water, Fire, and Wind shall suddenly be dissipated,
you will be like a crab with seven hands
and eight legs, thrown into boiling water. And
in that time do not say that you were never told
about the <i>Thing</i>.’... Now the <i>Thing</i>&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I do not want to hear about the Thing,” I
interrupted,&mdash;“nor about the crab with seven
hands and eight legs. I want to hear about the
clothes.”</p>

<p>“What clothes?”</p>

<p>“At the time of their meeting, the two Ts’ings
would have been differently dressed,&mdash;very differently,
perhaps; for one was a maid, and the
other a wife. Did the clothes of the two also
blend together? Suppose that one had a silk robe
and the other a robe of cotton, would these have
mixed into a texture of silk and cotton? Suppose
that one was wearing a blue girdle, and the other
a yellow girdle, would the result have been a green
girdle?... Or did one Ts’ing simply slip out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
of her costume, and leave it on the ground, like
the cast-off shell of a cicada?”</p>

<p>“None of the texts say anything about the
clothes,” my friend replied: “so I cannot tell you.
But the subject is quite irrelevant, from the Buddhist
point of view. The doctrinal question is the
question of what I suppose you would call the
personality of Ts’ing.”</p>

<p>“And yet it is not answered,” I said.</p>

<p>“It is best answered,” my friend replied, “by
not being answered.”</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“Because there is no such thing as personality.”</p>

<h4>I</h4>

<p>Behind my dwelling, but hidden from view
by a very lofty curtain of trees, there is
a Buddhist temple, with a cemetery attached
to it. The cemetery itself is in a grove of
pines, many centuries old; and the temple stands
in a great quaint lonesome garden. Its religious
name is <i>Ji-shō-in</i>; but the people call it Kobudera,
which means the Gnarled, or Knobby Temple, because
it is built of undressed timber,&mdash;great logs
of <i>hinoki</i>, selected for their beauty or strangeness
of shape, and simply prepared for the builder by
the removal of limbs and bark. But such gnarled
and knobby wood is precious: it is of the hardest
and most enduring, and costs far more than com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>mon
building-material,&mdash;as might be divined
from the fact that the beautiful alcoves and the
choicest parts of Japanese interiors are finished
with wood of a similar kind. To build Kobudera
was an undertaking worthy of a prince; and, as
a matter of history, it was a prince who erected
it, for a place of family worship. There is a
doubtful tradition that two designs were submitted
to him by the architect, and that he chose the
more fantastic one under the innocent impression
that undressed timber would prove cheap. But
whether it owes its existence to a mistake or not,
Kobudera remains one of the most interesting
temples of Japan. The public have now almost
forgotten its existence;&mdash;but it was famous in
the time of Iyemitsu; and its appellation, Ji-shō-in,
was taken from the kaimyō of one of the
great Shogun’s ladies, whose superb tomb may
be seen in its cemetery. Before Meiji, the temple
was isolated among woods and fields; but the city
has now swallowed up most of the green spaces
that once secluded it, and has pushed out the
ugliest of new streets directly in front of its
gate.</p>

<p>This gate&mdash;a structure of gnarled logs, with a
tiled and tilted Chinese roof&mdash;is a fitting pref<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>ace
to the queer style of the temple itself. From
either gable-end of the gate-roof, a demon-head,

visitor.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Within, except at the hours of prayer,
all is green silence. Children do not play in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
court&mdash;perhaps because the temple is a private
one. The ground is everywhere hidden by a fine
thick moss of so warm a color, that the brightest
foliage of the varied shrubbery above it looks
sombre by contrast; and the bases of walls, the
pedestals of monuments, the stonework of the
bell-tower, the masonry of the ancient well, are
muffled with the same luminous growth. Maples
and pines and cryptomerias screen the façade of
the temple; and, if your visit be in autumn, you
may find the whole court filled with the sweet
heavy perfume of the <i>mokusei</i><a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>-blossom. After
having looked at the strange temple, you would
find it worth while to enter the cemetery, by the
black gate on the west side of the court.</p>

<p class="tbpara">I like to wander in that cemetery,&mdash;partly because
in the twilight of its great trees, and in the
silence of centuries which has gathered about
them, one can forget the city and its turmoil, and
dream out of space and time,&mdash;but much more
because it is full of beauty, and of the poetry of
great faith. Indeed of such poetry it possesses
riches quite exceptional. Each Buddhist sect has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
its own tenets, rites, and forms; and the special
character of these is reflected in the iconography
and epigraphy of its burial-grounds,&mdash;so that for
any experienced eye a Tendai graveyard is readily
distinguishable from a Shingon graveyard, or a
Zen graveyard from one belonging to a Nichiren
congregation. But at Kobudera the inscriptions
and the sculptures peculiar to several Buddhist
sects can be studied side by side. Founded for
the Hokké, or Nichiren rite, the temple nevertheless
passed, in the course of generations, under
the control of other sects&mdash;the last being the
Tendai;&mdash;and thus its cemetery now offers a
most interesting medley of the emblems and the
epitaphic formularies of various persuasions. It
was here that I first learned, under the patient
teaching of an Oriental friend, something about
the Buddhist literature of the dead.</p>

<p class="tbpara">No one able to feel beauty could refuse to confess
the charm of the old Buddhist cemeteries,&mdash;with
their immemorial trees, their evergreen
mazes of shrubbery trimmed into quaintest
shapes, the carpet-softness of their mossed paths,
the weird but unquestionable art of their monuments.
And no great knowledge of Buddhism is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
needed to enable you, even at first sight, to understand
something of this art. You would recognize
the lotos chiselled upon tombs or water-tanks,
and would doubtless observe that the designs of
the pedestals represent a lotos of eight petals,&mdash;though
you might not know that these eight
petals symbolize the Eight Intelligences. You
would recognize the <i>manji</i>, or svastika, figuring
the Wheel of the Law,&mdash;though ignorant of
its relation to the Mahâyâna philosophy. You
would perhaps be able to recognize also the
images of certain Buddhas,&mdash;though not aware
of the meaning of their attitudes or emblems in
relation to mystical ecstasy or to the manifestation
of the Six Supernatural Powers. And you
would be touched by the simple pathos of the
offerings,&mdash;the incense and the flowers before
the tombs, the water poured out for the dead,&mdash;even
though unable to divine the deeper pathos
of the beliefs that make the cult. But unless an
excellent Chinese scholar as well as a Buddhist
philosopher, all book-knowledge of the great
religion would still leave you helpless in a world
of riddles. The marvellous texts,&mdash;the exquisite
Chinese scriptures chiselled into the granite
of tombs, or limned by a master-brush upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
smooth wood of the <i>sotoba</i>,&mdash;will yield their
secrets only to an interpreter of no common
powers. And the more you become familiar
with their aspect, the more the mystery of them
tantalizes,&mdash;especially after you have learned that
a literal translation of them would mean, in the
majority of cases, exactly nothing!</p>

<p class="tbpara">What strange thoughts have been thus recorded
and yet concealed? Are they complex
and subtle as the characters that stand for them?
Are they beautiful also like those characters,&mdash;with
some undreamed-of, surprising beauty, such
as might inform the language of another planet?</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>As for subtlety and complexity, much of this
mortuary literature is comparable to the Veil of
Isis. Behind the mystery of the text&mdash;in which
almost every character has two readings&mdash;there
is the mystery of the phrase; and again behind
this are successions of riddles belonging to a
gnosticism older than all the wisdom of the Occident,
and deep as the abysses of Space. Fortunately
the most occult texts are also the least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
interesting, and bear little relation to the purpose
of this essay. The majority are attached, not to
the sculptured, but to the written and impermanent
literature of cemeteries,&mdash;not to the stone
monuments, but to the sotoba: those tall narrow
laths of unpainted wood which are planted above
the graves at fixed, but gradually increasing intervals,
during a period of one hundred years.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter nobreak" style="width: 500px;">
<a href="images/zillt102ah.jpg">
<img class="border" src="images/zillt102a.jpg" width="500" height="349" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Sotoba in Kobudera Cemetery</span><br />(<i>The upper characters are “<span class="smcap">Bonti</span>”&mdash;modified Sanskrit</i>)</div>
</div>

<p>The uselessness of any exact translation of these
inscriptions may be exemplified by a word-for-word
rendering of two sentences written upon
the sotoba used by the older sects. What meaning
can you find in such a term as “Law-sphere-substance-nature-wisdom,”
or such an invocation
as “Ether, Wind, Fire, Water, Earth!”&mdash;for an
invocation it really is? To understand these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
words one must first know that, in the doctrine
of the mystical sects, the universe is composed
of Five Great Elements which are identical with
Five Buddhas; that each of the Five Buddhas
contains the rest; and that the Five are One by
essence, though varying in their phenomenal manifestations.
The name of an element has thus
three significations. The word Fire, for example,
means flame as objective appearance; it means
flame also as the manifestation of a particular
Buddha; and it likewise means the special quality
of wisdom or power attributed to that Buddha.
Perhaps this doctrine will be more easily understood
by the help of the following Shingon classification
of the Five Elements in their Buddhist
relations:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">I. <i>Hō-kai-tai-shō-chi</i></p>

<p>(Sansc. Dhârma-dhâtu-prakrit-gñâna), or “Law-sphere-substance-nature-wisdom,”&mdash;signifying
the wisdom that
becomes the substance of things. This is the element Ether.
Ether personified is Dai-Nichi-Nyōrai, the “Great Sun-Buddha”
(Mahâvairokana Tathâgata), who “holds the seal of
Wisdom.”</p>


<p class="center">II. <i>Dai-en-kyō-chi</i></p>

<p>(Âdarsana-gñâna), or “Great-round-mirror-wisdom,”&mdash;that
is to say the divine power making images manifest.
This is the element Earth. Earth personified is Ashuku
Nyōrai, the “Immovable Tathâgata” (Akshobhya).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">III. <i>Byō-dō-shō-chi</i></p>

<p>(Samatâ-gñâna), “Even-equal-nature-wisdom,”&mdash;that is,
the wisdom making no distinction of persons or of things.
The element Fire. Personified, Fire is Hō-shō Nyōrai, or
“Gem-Birth” Buddha (Ratnasambhava Tathâgata), presiding
over virtue and happiness.</p>


<p class="center">IV. <i>Myō-kwan-zatsu-chi</i></p>

<p>(Pratyavekshana-gñâna), “Wondrously-observing-considering-wisdom;”&mdash;that
is, the wisdom distinguishing
clearly truth from error, destroying doubts, and presiding
over the preaching of the Law. The element Water. Water
personified is Amida Nyōrai, the Buddha of Immeasurable
Light (Amitâbha Tathâgata).</p>


<p class="center">V. <i>Jō-shō-sa-chi</i></p>

<p>(Krityânushthâna-gñâna), the “Wisdom-of-accomplishing-what-is-to-be-done;”&mdash;that
is to say, the divine wisdom
that helps beings to reach Nirvana. The element Air.
Air personified is Fu-kū-jō-ju, the “Unfailing-of-Accomplishment,”&mdash;more
commonly called Fuku-Nyōrai (Amoghasiddhi,
or Sâkyamuni).<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p></div>

<p>Now the doctrine that each of the Five Buddhas
contains the rest, and that all are essentially One,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
is symbolized in these texts by an extraordinary
use of characters called <i>Bon-ji</i>,&mdash;which are recognizably
Sanscrit letters. The name of each
element can be written with any one of four
characters,&mdash;all having for Buddhists the same
meaning, though differing as to sound and form.
Thus the characters standing for Fire would read,
according to Japanese pronunciation, <i>Ra</i>, <i>Ran</i>,
<i>Raän</i>, and <i>Raku</i>;&mdash;and the characters signifying
Ether, <i>Kya</i>, <i>Ken</i>, <i>Keën</i>, and <i>Kyaku</i>. By different
combinations of the twenty characters making the
five sets, different supernatural powers and different
Buddhas are indicated; and the indication
is further helped by an additional symbolic
character, called <i>Shū-ji</i> or “seed-word,” placed
immediately after the names of the elements.
The reader will now comprehend the meaning
of the invocatory “Ether, Wind, Fire,
Water, Earth!” and of the strange names of
divine wisdom written upon sotoba; but the
enigmas offered by even a single sotoba may
be much more complicated than the foregoing
examples suggest. There are unimaginable
acrostics; there are rules, varying according to
sect, for the position of texts in relation to the
points of the compass; and there are kabalisms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
based upon the multiple values of certain Chinese
ideographs. The whole subject of esoteric inscriptions
would require volumes to explain; and the
reader will not be sorry, I fancy, to abandon it at
this point in favor of texts possessing a simpler
and a more humane interest.</p>

<p>The really attractive part of Buddhist cemetery-literature
mostly consists of sentences taken from
the sûtras or the sastras; and the attraction is
due not only to the intrinsic beauty of the faith
which these sentences express, but also to the
fact that they will be found to represent, in
epitome, a complete body of Buddhist doctrine.
Like the mystical inscriptions above-mentioned,
they belong to the sotoba, not to the gravestones;
but, while the invocations usually occupy
the upper and front part of the sotoba, these
sutra-texts are commonly written upon the back.
In addition to scriptural and invocatory texts,
each sotoba bears the name of the giver, the
kaimyō of the dead, and the name of a commemorative
anniversary. Sometimes a brief
prayer is also inscribed, or a statement of the
pious purpose inspiring the erection of the sotoba.
Before considering the scripture-texts proper, in
relation to their embodiment of doctrine, I sub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>mit
examples of the general character and plan of
sotoba inscriptions. They are written upon both
sides of the wood, be it observed; but I have not
thought it necessary to specify which texts belong
to the front, and which to the back of the sotoba,&mdash;since
the rules concerning such position differ
according to sect:&mdash;</p>

<p>The foregoing will doubtless suffice as specimens
of the ordinary forms of inscription. The
Buddha praised or invoked is always the Buddha
especially revered by the sect from whose sutra
or sastra the quotation is chosen;&mdash;sometimes also
the divine power of a Bodhisattva is extolled, as
in the following Zen inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>“The Sutra of Kwannon says:&mdash;‘In all
the provinces of all the countries in the Ten
Directions, there is not even one temple where
Kwannon is not self-revealed.’”</i></p></div>

<p>Sometimes the scripture text more definitely
assumes the character of a praise-offering, as the
following juxtaposition suggests:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>The Buddha of Immeasurable Light illuminates

Space.</i>”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This for the sake of the swift salvation into Buddhahood
of our lay-brother named the Great-Secure-Retired-Scholar.</p></div></div>

<p>Sometimes we also find a verse of praise or an
invocation addressed to the apotheosized spirit of
the founder of the sect,&mdash;a common example
being furnished by the sotoba of the Shingon
rite:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Hail to the Great Teacher Haijō-Kongō!</i>”<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p></div>

<p>Rarely the little prayer for the salvation of the
dead assumes, as in the following beautiful example,
the language of unconscious poetry:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>This for the sake of our noble Elder Sister
----. May the Lotos of Bliss by virtue of these
prayers be made to bloom for her, and to bear
the fruit of Buddhahood!</i>”<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p></div>

<p>But usually the prayers are of the simplest, and
differ from each other only in the use of peculiar
Buddhist terms:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&mdash;“This for the sake of the true happiness of our lay-brother&mdash;[<i>kaimyō</i>],&mdash;that
he may obtain the Supreme
Perfect Enlightenment.”</p>

<p>&mdash;“This tower is set up for the sake of &mdash;&mdash;, that he

<p>One other subject of interest belonging to the
merely commemorative texts of sotoba remains
to be mentioned,&mdash;the names of certain Buddhist
services for the dead. There are two classes of
such services: those performed within one hundred
days after death, and those celebrated at fixed
intervals during a term of one hundred years,&mdash;on
the 1st, 2d, 7th, 13th, 17th, 24th, 33d,
50th, and 100th anniversaries of the death. In
the Zen rite these commemorative services&mdash;(perhaps
we might call them masses)&mdash;have
singular mystical names by which they are
recorded upon the sotoba of the sect,&mdash;such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
as Lesser Happiness, Greater Happiness, Broad
Repose, The Bright Caress, and The Great
Caress.</p>

<p>But we shall now turn to the study of the
scripture-texts proper,&mdash;those citations from
sûtra or sastra which form the main portion of
a sotoba-writing; expounding the highest truth
of Buddhist belief, or speaking the deepest thought
of Eastern philosophy.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>At the beginning of my studies in the Kobudera
cemetery, I was not less impressed by the quiet
cheerfulness of the sotoba-texts, than by their
poetry and their philosophy. In none did I find
even a shadow of sadness: the greater number
were utterances of a faith that seemed to me
wider and deeper than our own,&mdash;sublime proclamations
of the eternal and infinite nature of
Thought, the unity of all mind, and the certainty
of universal salvation. And other surprises
awaited me in this strange literature. Texts or
fragments of texts, that at first rendering appeared
of the simplest, would yield to learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
commentary profundities of significance absolutely
startling. Phrases, seemingly artless, would suddenly
reveal a dual suggestiveness,&mdash;a two-fold
idealism,&mdash;a beauty at once exoteric and mystical.
Of this latter variety of inscription the
following is a good example:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>The flower having bloomed last night, the
World has become fragrant.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p></div>

<p>In the language of the higher Buddhism, this
means that through death a spirit has been released
from the darkness of illusion, even as the
perfume of a blossom is set free at the breaking
of the bud, and that the divine Absolute, or
World of Law, is refreshed by the new presence,
as a whole garden might be made fragrant by
the blooming of some precious growth. But in
the popular language of Buddhism, the same
words signify that in the Lotos-Lake of Paradise
another magical flower has opened for the Apparitional
Rebirth into highest bliss of the being
loved and lost on earth, and that Heaven rejoices
for the advent of another Buddha.</p>

<p class="tbpara">But I desire rather to represent the general
result of my studies, than to point out the special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
beauties of this epitaphic literature: and my purpose
will be most easily attained by arranging
and considering the inscriptions in a certain
doctrinal order.</p>

<p>A great variety of sotoba-texts refer, directly
or indirectly, to the Lotos-Flower Paradise of
Amida,&mdash;or, as it is more often called, the Paradise
of the West. The following are typical:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>The Amida-Kyō says:&mdash;‘All who enter into
that country enter likewise into that state of
virtue from which there can be no turning
back.’</i>”<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>“<i>The Text of Gold proclaims:&mdash;‘In that
world they receive bliss only: therefore that
world is called Gokuraku,&mdash;exceeding bliss.’</i>”<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
<p>“<i>Hail unto the Lord Amida Buddha! The
Golden Mouth has said,&mdash;‘All living beings that
fix their thoughts upon the Buddha shall be received
and welcomed into his Paradise;&mdash;never
shall they be forsaken.’</i>”<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p></div>

<p>But texts like these, though dear to popular
faith, make no appeal to the higher Buddhism,
which admits heaven as a temporary condition
only, not to be desired by the wise. Indeed, the
Mahâyâna texts, describing Sukhâvatî, themselves
suggest its essentially illusive character,&mdash;a world
of jewel-lakes and perfumed airs and magical
birds, but a world also in which the voices of
winds and waters and singers perpetually preach
the unreality of self and the impermanency of all
things. And even the existence of this Western
Paradise might seem to be denied in other sotoba-texts
of deeper significance,&mdash;such as this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Originally,”&mdash;that is to say, in relation to the
Infinite. The relations and the ideas of the Conditioned
cease to exist for the Unconditioned. Yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
this truth does not really imply denial of other
worlds of relation,&mdash;states of bliss to which the
strong may rise, and states of pain to which the
weak may descend. It is a reminder only. All
conditions are impermanent, and so, in the profounder
sense, unreal. The Absolute,&mdash;the Supreme
Buddha,&mdash;is the sole Reality. This doctrine
appears in many sotoba-inscriptions:&mdash;</p>

phenomenal universe. Yet the universe exists but
as a dream of Mind:&mdash;</p>

<p>The universe is a phantom, and a phantom
likewise the body of man, together with all emotions,
ideas, and memories that make up the
complex of his sensuous Self. But is this evanescent
Self the whole of man’s inner being? Not
so, proclaim the sotoba:&mdash;</p>

<p>Yet what of the Buddhas who successively

their individuality also unreal? Probably the

says:&mdash;‘This doctrine is equal and alike for all;

<p>And a still more wonderful text&mdash;(to my
thinking, the most remarkable of all Buddhist
texts)&mdash;declares that the world itself, phantom
though it be, is yet not different from Mind:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>Literally, “shall become Buddha;” that is,
they shall enter into Buddhahood or Nirvana.
All that we term matter will be transmuted
therefore into Mind,&mdash;Mind with the attributes
of Infinite Sentiency, Infinite Vision, and Infinite
Knowledge. As phenomenon, matter is unreal;
but transcendentally it belongs by its ultimate
nature to the Sole Reality.</p>

<p>Such a philosophical position is likely to puzzle
the average reader. To call matter and mind but
two aspects of the Ultimate Reality will not seem
irrational to students of Herbert Spencer. But to
say that matter is a phenomenon, an illusion, a
dream, explains nothing;&mdash;as phenomenon it
exists, and having a destiny attributed to it, must
be considered objectively. Equally unsatisfying
is the statement that phenomena are aggregates
of Karma. What is the nature of the particles
of the aggregate? Or, in plainest language, what
is the illusion made of?</p>

<p>Not in the original Buddhist scriptures, and
still less in the literature of Buddhist cemeteries,
need the reply be sought. Such questions are
dealt with in the sastras rather than in the sûtras;&mdash;also
in various Japanese commentaries upon
both. A friend has furnished me with some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
very curious and unfamiliar Shingon texts containing
answers to the enigma.</p>

<p>The Shingon sect, I may observe, is a mystical
sect, which especially proclaims the identity of
mind and substance, and boldly carries out the
doctrine to its furthest logical consequences. Its
founder and father Kū-kai, better known as Kōbōdaishi,
declared in his book <i>Hizōki</i> that matter is
not different in essence from spirit. “As to the
doctrine of grass, trees, and things non-sentient
becoming Buddhas” he writes, “I say that the
refined forms [<i>ultimate nature</i>] of spiritual bodies
consist of the Five Great Elements; that Ether<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
consists of the Five Great Elements; and that
the refined forms of bodies spiritual, of ether, of
plants, of trees, consequently pervade all space.
This ether, these plants and trees, are themselves
spiritual bodies. To the eye of flesh, plants and
trees appear to be gross matter. But to the eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
of the Buddha <i>they are composed of minute spiritual
entities</i>. Therefore, even without any
change in their substance, there can be no error
or impropriety in our calling them Buddhas.”</p>

<p>The use of the term “non-sentient” in the
foregoing would seem to involve a contradiction;
but this is explained away by a dialogue in the
book <i>Shi-man-gi</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Q.&mdash;Are not grass and trees sometimes called sentient?</p>

<p>A.&mdash;They can be so called.</p>

<p>Q.&mdash;But they have also been called non-sentient: how
can they be called sentient?</p>

<p>A.&mdash;In all substance from the beginning exists the impress
of the wisdom-nature of the Nyōrai (<i>Tathâgata</i>):
therefore to call such things sentient is not error.</p></div>

<p class="tbpara">“Potentially sentient,” the reader might conclude;
but this conclusion would be wrong. The
Shingon thought is not of a potential sentiency,
but of a latent sentiency which although to us
non-apparent and non-imaginable, is nevertheless
both real and actual. Commenting upon the
words of Kōbōdaishi above cited, the great priest
Yū-kai not only reiterates the opinion of his
master, but asserts that it is absurd to deny that
plants, trees, and what we call inanimate objects,
can practise virtue! “Since Mind,” he declares,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
“pervades the whole World of Law, the grasses,
plants, trees, and earth pervaded by it must all
have mind, and must turn their mind to Buddhahood
and practise virtue. Do not doubt the doctrine
of our sect, regarding the Non-Duality of
the Pervading and the Pervaded, merely because
of the distinction made in common parlance between
Matter and Mind.” As for <i>how</i> plants or
stones can practise virtue, the sûtras indeed have
nothing to say. But that is because the sûtras,
being intended for man, teach only what man
should know and do.</p>

<p>The reader will now, perhaps, be better able to
follow out the really startling Buddhist hypothesis
of the nature of matter to its more than startling
conclusion. (It must not be contemned
because of the fantasy of five elements; for these
are declared to be only modes of one ultimate.)
All forms of what we call matter are really but
aggregates of spiritual units; and all apparent
differences of substance represent only differences
of combination among these units. The differences
of combination are caused by special tendencies
and affinities of the units;&mdash;the tendency
of each being the necessary result of its particular
evolutional history&mdash;(using the term “evolu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>tional”
in a purely ethical sense). All integrations
of apparent substance,&mdash;the million suns
and planets of the universe,&mdash;represent only the
affinities of such ghostly ultimates; and every
human act or thought registers itself through
enormous time by some knitting or loosening of
forces working for good or evil.</p>

<p class="tbpara">Grass, trees, earth, and all things seem to us
what they are not, simply because the eye of
flesh is blind. Life itself is a curtain hiding
reality,&mdash;somewhat as the vast veil of day conceals
from our sight the countless orbs of Space.
But the texts of the cemeteries proclaim that the
purified mind, even while prisoned within the
body, may enter for moments of ecstasy into
union with the Supreme:&mdash;</p>

<p>Visitors to the older Buddhist temples of Japan
can scarcely fail to notice the remarkable character
of the gilded aureoles attached to certain
images. These aureoles, representing circles,
disks, or ovals of glory, contain numbers of little
niches shaped like archings or whirls of fire, each
enshrining a Buddha or a Bodhisattva. A verse
of the Amitâyur-Dhyâna Sûtra might have suggested
this symbolism to the Japanese sculptors:&mdash;“<i>In
the halo of that Buddha there are Buddhas
innumerable as the sands of the Ganga.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
Icon and verse alike express that doctrine of the
One in Many suggested by the foregoing sotoba-texts;
and the assurance that he who sees one
Buddha can see all, may further be accepted as
signifying that he who perceives one great truth
fully, will be able to perceive countless truths.</p>

<p>But even to the spiritually blind the light must
come at last. A host of cemetery texts proclaim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the Infinite Love that watches all, and the certainty
of ultimate and universal salvation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Possessing all the Virtues and all the
Powers, the Eyes of the Infinite Compassion behold
all living creatures.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

their minds and their bodies alike shall be freed
from desire; and they shall obtain the Supreme
Enlightenment.’</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>The Sûtra says:&mdash;‘Changing the hearts of
all beings, I cause them to enter upon the Way of
Buddhahood.’</i>”<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p></div>

<p>Yet the supreme conquest can be achieved only

<p>The Three Existences signify time past, present,
and future. To rise above&mdash;(more literally, to
“emerge from”)&mdash;the Three Existences means
therefore to pass beyond Space and Time,&mdash;to
become one with the Infinite. The conquest of
Time is indeed possible only for a Buddha; but
all shall become Buddhas. Even a woman, while
yet a woman, may reach Buddhahood, as this

<h4>IV</h4>

<p>Though not representing, nor even suggesting,
the whole range of sotoba-literature, the foregoing
texts will sufficiently indicate the quality of
its philosophical interest. The inscriptions of the
<i>haka</i>, or tombs, have another kind of interest;
but before treating of these, a few words should
be said about the tombs themselves. I cannot
attempt detail, because any description of the
various styles of such monuments would require
a large and profusely illustrated volume; while
the study of their sculptures belongs to the enormous
subject of Buddhist iconography,&mdash;foreign
to the purpose of this essay.</p>

<p>There are hundreds,&mdash;probably thousands,&mdash;of
different forms of Buddhist funeral monuments,&mdash;ranging
from the unhewn boulder, with
a few ideographs scratched on it, of the poorest
village-graveyard, to the complicated turret (<i>kagé-kio</i>)
enclosing a shrine with images, and surmounted
with a spire of umbrella-shaped disks or
parasols (Sanscrit: <i>tchâtras</i>),&mdash;possibly representing
the old Chinese stûpa. The most common
class of <i>haka</i> are plain. A large number of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
better class have lotos-designs chiselled upon some
part of them:&mdash;either the pedestal is sculptured
so as to represent lotos-petals; or a single blossom
is cut in relief or intaglio on the face of the tablet;
or&mdash;(but this is rare)&mdash;a whole lotos-plant,
leaves and flowers, is designed in relief upon one
or two sides of the monument. In the costly
class of tombs symbolizing the Five Buddhist
Elements, the eight-petalled lotos-symbol may be
found repeated, with decorative variations, upon
three or four portions of their elaborate structure.
Occasionally we find beautiful reliefs upon tombstones,&mdash;images
of Buddhas or Bodhisattvas;
and not unfrequently a statue of Jizō may be seen
erected beside a grave. But the sculptures of
this class are mostly old;&mdash;the finest pieces in
the Kobudera cemetery, for example, were executed
between two and three hundred years ago.
Finally I may observe that the family crest or
<i>mon</i> of the dead is cut upon the front of the
tomb, and sometimes also upon the little stone
tank set before it.</p>

<p class="tbpara">The inscriptions very seldom include any texts
from the holy books. On the front of the monument,
below the chiselled crest, the kaimyō is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
graven, together, perhaps, with a single mystical
character&mdash;Sanscrit or Chinese; on the left side
is usually placed the record of the date of death;
and on the right, the name of the person or
family erecting the tomb. Such is now, at least,
the ordinary arrangement; but there are numerous
exceptions; and as the characters are most
often disposed in vertical columns, it is quite easy
to put all the inscriptions upon the face of a very
narrow monument. Occasionally the real name
is also cut upon some part of the stone,&mdash;together,
perhaps, with some brief record of the
memorable actions of the dead. Excepting the
kaimyō, and the sect-invocation often accompanying
it, the inscriptions upon the ordinary class of
tombs are secular in character; and the real interest
of such epigraphy is limited to the kaimyō.
By <i>kai</i>-myō (<i>sîla</i>-name) is meant the Buddhist
name given to the spirit of the dead, according to
the custom of all sects except the Ikkō or Shinshū.
In a special sense the term <i>kai</i>, or sîla, refers to
precepts of conduct<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>; in a general sense it might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
be rendered as “salvation by works.” But the
Shinshū allows no <i>kai</i> to any mortal; it does
not admit the doctrine of immediate salvation by
works, but only by faith in Amida; and the
posthumous appellations which it bestows are
therefore called not <i>kai</i>-myō, but <i>hō-myō</i>, or
“Law-names.”</p>

<p>Before Meiji the social rank occupied by any
one during life was suggested by the kaimyō.
The use, with a kaimyō, of the two characters
reading <i>in den</i>, and signifying “temple-dweller,”
or “mansion-dweller,”&mdash;or of the more common
single character <i>in</i>, signifying “temple” or
“mansion,” was a privilege reserved to the nobility
and gentry. Class-distinctions were further
indicated by suffixes. <i>Koji</i>,&mdash;a term partly corresponding
to our “lay-brother,”&mdash;and <i>Daishi</i>,
“great elder-sister,” were honorifically attached to
the kaimyō of the samurai and the aristocracy;
while the simpler appellations of <i>Shinshi</i> and
<i>Shinnyo</i>, respectively signifying “faithful [believing]
man,” “faithful woman,” followed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
kaimyō of the humble. These forms are still used;
but the distinctions they once maintained have
mostly passed away, and the privilege of the
knightly “<i>in den</i>,” and its accompaniments, is
free to any one willing to pay for it. At all
times the words <i>Dōji</i> and <i>Dōnyo</i> seem to have
been attached to the kaimyō of children. <i>Dō</i>,
alone, means a lad, but when combined with <i>ji</i> or
<i>nyo</i> it means “child” in the adjectival sense;&mdash;so
that we may render <i>Dōji</i> as “Child-son,” and
<i>Dōnyo</i> as “Child-daughter.” Children are thus
called who die before reaching their fifteenth year,&mdash;the
majority-year by the old samurai code;
a lad of fifteen being deemed fit for war-service.
In the case of children who die within a year
after birth, the terms <i>Gaini</i> and <i>Gainyo</i> occasionally
replace <i>Dōji</i> and <i>Dōnyo</i>. The syllable <i>Gai</i>
here represents a Chinese character meaning
“suckling.”</p>

<p>Different Buddhists sects have different formulas
for the composition of the kaimyō and
its addenda;&mdash;but this subject would require a
whole special treatise; and I shall mention only
a few sectarian customs. The Shingon sect sometimes
put a Sanscrit character&mdash;the symbol of
a Buddha&mdash;before their kaimyō;&mdash;the Shin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
head theirs with an abbreviation of the holy
name Sakyamuni;&mdash;the Nichiren often preface
their inscriptions with the famous invocation,
<i>Namu myō hō rengé kyō</i> (“Hail to the Sutra of
the Lotos of the Good Law!”),&mdash;sometimes
followed by the words <i>Senzo daidai</i> (“forefathers
of the generations”);&mdash;the Jōdo, like
the Ikkō, use an abbreviation of the name Sakyamuni,
or, occasionally, the invocation <i>Namu
Amida Butsu!</i>&mdash;and they compose their four-character
kaimyō with the aid of two ideographs
signifying “honour” or “fame;”&mdash;the Zen
sect contrive that the first and the last character
of the kaimyō, when read together, shall form a
particular Buddhist term, or mystical phrase,&mdash;except
when the kaimyō consists of only two
characters.</p>

<p>Probably the word “mansion” in kaimyō-inscriptions
would suggest to most Western readers
the idea of heavenly mansions. But the fancy
would be at fault. The word has no celestial
signification; yet the history of its epitaphic use
is curious enough. Anciently, at the death of
any illustrious man, a temple was erected for the
special services due to his spirit, and also for the
conservation of relics or memorials of him. Con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>fucianism
introduced into Japan the <i>ihai</i>, or mortuary
tablet, called by the Chinese <i>shin-shu</i>;<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and
a portion of the temple was set apart to serve as
a chapel for the <i>ihai</i>, and the ancestral cult. Any
such memorial temple was called <i>in</i>, or “mansion,”&mdash;doubtless
because the august spirit was
believed to occupy it at certain periods;&mdash;and
the term yet survives in the names of many
celebrated Buddhist temples,&mdash;such as the Chion-In,
of Kyōtō. With the passing of time, this
custom was necessarily modified; for as privileges
were extended and aristocracies multiplied, the
erection of a separate temple to each notable
presently became impossible. Buddhism met the
difficulty by conferring upon every individual of
distinction the posthumous title of <i>in-den</i>,&mdash;and
affixing to this title the name of an imaginary
temple or “mansion.” So to-day, in the vast
majority of kaimyō, the character <i>in</i> refers only
to the temple that would have been built had circumstance
permitted, but now exists only in the
pious desire of those who love and reverence the
departed.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Tomb in Kobudera Cemetery</span><br />(The relief represents Seishi Bosatsu&mdash;Bodhisattva Mahâsthâma&mdash;in meditation. It is 187 years old. The white patches on the surface are lichen growths)</div>
</div>

<p>Nevertheless the poetry of these <i>in</i>-names does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
possess some real meaning. They are nearly all
of them names such as would be given to real
Buddhist temples,&mdash;names of virtues and sanctities
and meditations,&mdash;names of ecstasies and
powers and splendors and luminous immeasurable
unfoldings,&mdash;names of all ways and means of
escape from the Six States of Existence and the
sorrow of “peopling the cemeteries again and
again.”</p>

<p class="tbpara">The general character and arrangement of
kaimyō can best be understood by the aid of a
few typical specimens. The first example is from
a beautiful tomb in the cemetery of Kobudera,
which is sculptured with a relief representing the
Bodhisattva Mahâsthâma (Seishi Bosatsu) meditating.
All the text in this instance has been cut
upon the face of the monument, to left and right
of the icon. Transliterated into Romaji it reads
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>For the sake of clearness, I have printed the
posthumous name proper (<i>Hō-sō Myō-shin</i>) in
small capitals, and the rest in italics. The first
three characters of the inscription,&mdash;<i>Tei-Shō-In</i>,&mdash;form
the name of the temple, or “mansion.”
The pine, both in religious and secular poetry, is
a symbol of changeless conditions of good, because
it remains freshly-green in all seasons. The
use of the term “Reality” in the kaimyō indicates
the state of unity with the Absolute;&mdash;by “Window-of-Law”
(Law here signifying the Buddha-state)
must be understood that exercise of virtue
through which even in this existence some percep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>tion
of Infinite Truth may be obtained. I have
already explained the final word, <i>Daishi</i> (“great
elder-sister”).</p>

<p>Less mystical, but not less beautiful, is this
Nichiren kaimyō sculptured upon the grave of
a young samurai:</p>

<p>After having studied the sotoba-texts previously
cited, the reader should be able to divine the
meaning of most of the kaimyō above given.
At all events he will understand such frequently-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>repeated
terms as “Moon,” “Lotos,” “Law.”
But he may be puzzled by other expressions; and
some further explanation will, perhaps, not be
unwelcome.</p>

<p>Besides expressing a pious hope for the higher
happiness of the departed, or uttering some
assurance of special conditions in the spiritual
world, a great number of kaimyō also refer,
directly or indirectly, to the character of the vanished
personality. Thus a man of widely-recognized
integrity and strong moral purpose, may&mdash;like
my dead friend&mdash;be not unfitly named:
“Bright-Sun-on-the-Way-of-the-Wise.” The
child-daughter or the young wife, especially remembered
for sweetness of character, may be commemorated
by some such posthumous name as
“Plumflower-Light,” or “Luminous-Shadow-of-the-Plumflower-Chamber;”&mdash;the
word “plumflower” in either case at once suggesting the
quality of the virtue of the dead, because this
blossom in Japan is the emblem of feminine
moral charm,&mdash;more particularly faithfulness to
duty and faultless modesty. Again, the memory
of any person noted for deeds of charity may
be honoured by such a kaimyō as, “Effective-Benevolence-Listening-with-Pure-Heart-to-the-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>Supplications-of-the-Poor.”
Finally I may
observe that the kaimyō-terms expressing altitude,
luminosity, and fragrance, have most often
a moral-exemplary signification. But in all
countries epitaphic literature has its conventional
hypocrisies or extravagances. Buddhist kaimyō
frequently contain a great deal of religious
flattery; and beautiful posthumous names are
often given to those whose lives were the reverse
of beautiful.</p>

<p>When we find among feminine kaimyō such
appellations as “Wondrous-Lotos,” or “Beautiful-as-the-Lotos-of-the-Dawn,”
we may be sure in
the generality of cases that the charm, to which
reference is so made, was ethical only. Yet there
are exceptions; and the more remarkable of these
are furnished by the kaimyō of children. Names
like “Dream-of-Spring,” “Radiant-Phantasm,”
“Snowy-Bubble,” do actually refer to the lost
form,&mdash;or at least to the supposed parental idea
of vanished beauty and grace. But such names
also exemplify a peculiar consolatory application
of the Buddhist doctrine of Impermanency. We
might say that through the medium of these
kaimyō the bereaved are thus soothed in the
loftiest language of faith:&mdash;“Beautiful and brief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
was the being of your child,&mdash;a dream of spring,
a radiant passing vision,&mdash;a snowy bubble. But
in the order of eternal law all forms must pass;
material permanency there is none: only the
divine Absolute dwelling in every being,&mdash;only
the Buddha in the heart of each of us,&mdash;forever
endures. Be this great truth at once your comfort
and your hope!”</p>

<p class="tbpara">Extraordinary examples of the retrospective
significance sometimes given to posthumous
names, are furnished by the kaimyō of the
Forty-Seven Rōnin buried at Sengakuji in
Tōkyō. (Their story is now well-known to all
the English-reading world through Mitford’s
eloquent and sympathetic version of it in the
“Tales of Old Japan.”) The noteworthy peculiarity
of these kaimyō is that each contains
the two words, “dagger” and “sword,”&mdash;used
in a symbolic sense, but having also an appropriate
military suggestiveness. Ōïshi Kuranosuké
Yoshiwo, the leader, is alone styled <i>Koji</i>;&mdash;the
kaimyō of his followers have the humbler suffix
<i>Shinshi</i>. Ōïshi’s kaimyō reads:&mdash;“<i>Dagger-of-Emptiness-and-stainless-Sword,
in the Mansion
of Earnest Loyalty</i>.” I need scarcely call atten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>tion
to the historic meaning of the mansion-name.
Three of the kaimyō of his followers will serve
as examples of the rest. That of Masé Kyudayu
Masaake is:&mdash;“<i>Dagger-of-Fame-and-Sword-of-the-Way
[or Doctrine.]</i>” The kaimyō of Ōïshi
Sezayémon Nobukiyo is:&mdash;“<i>Dagger-of-Magnanimity-and-Sword-of-Virtue.</i>”
And the
kaimyō of Horibei Yasubei is:&mdash;“<i>Dagger-of-Cloud-and-Sword-of-Brightness.</i>”</p>

<p>The first and the last of these four kaimyō will
be found obscure; and several more of the forty-seven
inscriptions are equally enigmatic at first
sight. Usually in a kaimyō the word “Emptiness,”
or “Void,” signifies the Buddhist state of
absolute spiritual purity,&mdash;the state of Unconditioned
Being. But in the kaimyō of Ōïshi
Kuranosuké the meaning of it, though purely
Buddhist, is very different. By “emptiness”
here, we must understand “illusion,” “unreality,”&mdash;and
the full meaning of the phrase “dagger-emptiness”
is:&mdash;“<i>Wisdom that, seeing the
emptiness of material forms, pierces through
illusion as a dagger.</i>” In Horibei Yasubei’s kaimyō
we must similarly render the word “cloud”
by illusion; and “Dagger-of-Cloud” should be
interpreted, “<i>Illusion-penetrating Dagger of Wis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>dom.</i>”
The wisdom that perceives the emptiness
of phenomena, is the sharply-dividing, or distinguishing
wisdom,&mdash;is <i>Myō-kwan-zatsu-chi</i>
(Pratyavekshana-gñâna).</p>


<h4>V</h4>

<p>Possibly I have presumed too much upon the
patience of my readers; yet I feel that these studies
can yield scarcely more than the glimpse of a
subject wide and deep as a sea. If they should
arouse any Western interest in the philosophy and
the poetry of Buddhist epitaphic literature, then
they will certainly have accomplished all that I
could reasonably hope.</p>

<p>Not improbably I shall be accused, as I have
been on other occasions, of trying to make Buddhist
texts “more beautiful than they are.” This
charge usually comes from persons totally ignorant
of the originals, and betrays a spirit of
disingenuousness with which I have no sympathy.
Whoever confesses religion to have been a developing
influence in the social and moral history of
races,&mdash;whoever grants that respect is due to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
convictions which have shaped the nobler courses
of human conduct for thousands of years,&mdash;whoever
acknowledges that in any great religion
something of eternal truth must exist,&mdash;will hold
it the highest duty of a translator to interpret the
concepts of an alien faith as generously as he
would wish his own thoughts or words interpreted
by his fellow-men. In the rendering of Chinese
sentences this duty presents itself under a peculiar
aspect. Any attempt at literal translation would
result in the production either of nonsense, or of a
succession of ideas totally foreign to far-Eastern
thought. The paramount necessity in treating
such texts is to discover and to expound the
thought conveyed to Oriental minds by the
original ideographs,&mdash;which are very different
things indeed from “written words.” The translations
given in this essay were made by Japanese
scholars, and, in their present form, have the
approval of competent critics.</p>

<p>Few of the simpler sense-impressions of
travel remain more intimately and vividly
associated with the memory of a strange
land than sounds,&mdash;sounds of the open country.
Only the traveller knows how Nature’s voices&mdash;voices
of forest and river and plain&mdash;vary according
to zone; and it is nearly always some
local peculiarity of their tone or character that
appeals to feeling and penetrates into memory,&mdash;giving
us the sensation of the foreign and the
far-away. In Japan this sensation is especially
aroused by the music of insects,&mdash;hemiptera
uttering a sound-language wonderfully different
from that of their Western congeners. To a
lesser degree the exotic accent is noticeable also
in the chanting of Japanese frogs,&mdash;though the
sound impresses itself upon remembrance rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
by reason of its ubiquity. Rice being cultivated
all over the country,&mdash;not only upon mountain-slopes
and hill-tops, but even within the limits of
the cities,&mdash;there are flushed levels everywhere,
and everywhere frogs. No one who has travelled
in Japan will forget the clamor of the ricefields.</p>

<p>Hushed only during the later autumn and brief
winter, with the first wakening of spring waken
all the voices of the marsh-lands,&mdash;the infinite
bubbling chorus that might be taken for the
speech of the quickening soil itself. And the
universal mystery of life seems to thrill with a
peculiar melancholy in that vast utterance&mdash;heard
through forgotten thousands of years
by forgotten generations of toilers, but doubtless
older by myriad ages than the race of man.</p>

<p>Now this song of solitude has been for centuries
a favorite theme with Japanese poets; but
the Western reader may be surprised to learn that
it has appealed to them rather as a pleasant sound
than as a nature-manifestation.</p>

<p class="tbpara">Innumerable poems have been written about
the singing of frogs; but a large proportion of
them would prove unintelligible if understood as
referring to common frogs. When the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
chorus of the ricefield finds praise in Japanese
verse, the poet expresses his pleasure only in the
great volume of sound produced by the blending
of millions of little croakings,&mdash;a blending which
really has a pleasant effect, well compared to the
lulling sound of the falling of rain. But when
the poet pronounces an individual frog-call melodious,
he is not speaking of the common frog of
the ricefields. Although most kinds of Japanese
frogs are croakers, there is one remarkable exception&mdash;(not
to mention tree-frogs),&mdash;the <i>kajika</i>,
or true singing-frog of Japan. To say that it
croaks would be an injustice to its note, which is
sweet as the chirrup of a song-bird. It used to be
called <i>kawazu</i>; but as this ancient appellation
latterly became confounded in common parlance
with <i>kaeru</i>, the general name for ordinary frogs,
it is now called only <i>kajika</i>. The <i>kajika</i> is kept
as a domestic pet, and is sold in Tōkyō by several
insect-merchants. It is housed in a peculiar cage,
the lower part of which is a basin containing sand
and pebbles, fresh water and small plants; the
upper part being a framework of fine wire-gauze.
Sometimes the basin is fitted up as a <i>ko-niwa</i>,
or model landscape-garden. In these times the
kajika is considered as one of the singers of spring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
and summer; but formerly it was classed with
the melodists of autumn; and people used to
make autumn-trips to the country for the mere
pleasure of hearing it sing. And just as various
places used to be famous for the music of particular
varieties of night-crickets, so there were
places celebrated only as haunts of the kajika.
The following were especially noted:&mdash;</p>

<p>Tamagawa and Ōsawa-no-Iké,&mdash;a river and a
lake in the province of Yamashiro.</p>

<p>Miwagawa, Asukagawa, Sawogawa, Furu-no-Yamada,
and Yoshinogawa,&mdash;all in the province
of Yamato.</p>

<p>Koya-no-Iké,&mdash;in Settsu.</p>

<p>Ukinu-no-Iké,&mdash;in Iwami.</p>

<p>Ikawa-no-Numa,&mdash;in Kōzuké.</p>

<p>Now it is the melodious cry of the kajika, or
kawazu, which is so often praised in far-Eastern
verse; and, like the music of insects, it is mentioned
in the oldest extant collections of Japanese
poems. In the preface to the famous anthology
called <i>Kokinshū</i>, compiled by Imperial Decree
during the fifth year of the period of Engi
(<span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 905), the poet Ki-no-Tsurayuki, chief
editor of the work, makes these interesting observations:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>&mdash;“The poetry of Japan has its roots in the
human heart, and thence has grown into a multi-form
utterance. Man in this world, having a
thousand millions of things to undertake and to
complete, has been moved to express his thoughts
and his feelings concerning all that he sees and
hears. When we hear the <i>uguisu</i><a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> singing
among flowers, and the voice of the kawazu
which inhabits the waters, what mortal [<i>lit.:
‘who among the living that lives’</i>] does not
compose poems?”</p>

<p>The kawazu thus referred to by Tsurayuki is
of course the same creature as the modern
kajika: no common frog could have been mentioned
as a songster in the same breath with that
wonderful bird, the uguisu. And no common
frog could have inspired any classical poet with
so pretty a fancy as this:&mdash;</p>

<span class="i2">Té wo tsuité,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uta moshi-aguru,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Kawazu kana!<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>“With hands resting on the ground, reverentially
you repeat your poem, O frog!” The charm of
this little verse can best be understood by those
familiar with the far-Eastern etiquette of posture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
while addressing a superior,&mdash;kneeling, with the
body respectfully inclined, and hands resting upon
the floor, with the fingers pointing outwards.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>It is scarcely possible to determine the antiquity
of the custom of writing poems about
frogs; but in the <i>Manyōshū</i>, dating back to the
middle of the eighth century, there is a poem
which suggests that even at that time the river
Asuka had long been famous for the singing of
its frogs:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Ima mo ka mo<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Asuka no kawa no<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yū sarazu<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kawazu naku sé no<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kiyoku aruran.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>“Still clear in our day remains the stream of
Asuka, where the kawazu nightly sing.” We
find also in the same anthology the following
curious reference to the singing of frogs:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Omoboyezu<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kimaseru kimi wo,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sasagawa no<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kawazu kikasezu<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kayeshi tsuru kamo!<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>
<p>“Unexpectedly I received the august visit of my
lord.... Alas, that he should have returned
without hearing the frogs of the river Sawa!”
And in the <i>Rokujōshū</i>, another ancient compilation,
are preserved these pleasing verses on the
same theme:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Tamagawa no<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hito wo mo yogizu<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Naku kawazu,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kono yū kikéba<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oshiku ya wa aranu?<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>“Hearing to-night the frogs of the Jewel River
[or Tamagawa], that sing without fear of man,
how can I help loving the passing moment?”</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>Thus it appears that for more than eleven
hundred years the Japanese have been making
poems about frogs; and it is at least possible that
verses on this subject, which have been preserved
in the <i>Manyōshū</i>, were composed even earlier than
the eighth century. From the oldest classical
period to the present day, the theme has never
ceased to be a favorite one with poets of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
ranks. A fact noteworthy in this relation is that
the first poem written in the measure called
<i>hokku</i>, by the famous Bashō, was about frogs.
The triumph of this extremely brief form of
verse&mdash;(three lines of 5, 7, and 5 syllables respectively)&mdash;is
to create one complete sensation-picture;
and Bashō’s original accomplishes the
feat,&mdash;difficult, if not impossible, to repeat in
English:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Furu iké ya,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kawazu tobikomu,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Midzu no oto.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>(“Old pond&mdash;frogs jumping in&mdash;sound of
water.”) An immense number of poems about
frogs were subsequently written in this measure.
Even at the present time professional men of
letters amuse themselves by making short poems
on frogs. Distinguished among these is a young
poet known to the Japanese literary world by the
pseudonym of “Roséki,” who lives in Ōsaka and
keeps in the pond of his garden hundreds of singing
frogs. At fixed intervals he invites all his
poet-friends to a feast, with the proviso that each
must compose, during the entertainment, one poem
about the inhabitants of the pond. A collection
of the verses thus obtained was privately printed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
in the spring of 1897, with funny pictures of
frogs decorating the covers and illustrating the
text.</p>

<p>But unfortunately it is not possible through
English translation to give any fair idea of the
range and character of the literature of frogs.
The reason is that the greater number of compositions
about frogs depend chiefly for their literary
value upon the untranslatable,&mdash;upon local
allusions, for example, incomprehensible outside
of Japan; upon puns; and upon the use of words
with double or even triple meanings. Scarcely
two or three in every one hundred poems can
bear translation. So I can attempt little more
than a few general observations.</p>

<p class="tbpara">That love-poems should form a considerable
proportion of this curious literature will not seem
strange to the reader when he is reminded that
the lovers’ trysting-hour is also the hour when
the frog-chorus is in full cry, and that, in Japan
at least, the memory of the sound would be
associated with the memory of a secret meeting
in almost any solitary place. The frog referred
to in such poems is not usually the kajika. But
frogs are introduced into love-poetry in countless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
clever ways. I can give two examples of modern
popular compositions of this kind. The first contains
an allusion to the famous proverb,&mdash;<i>I no
naka no kawazu daikai wo shirazu</i>: “The frog
in the well knows not the great sea.” A person
quite innocent of the ways of the world is compared
to a frog in a well; and we may suppose
the speaker of the following lines to be some
sweet-hearted country-girl, answering an ungenerous
remark with very pretty tact:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<i><span class="i0">Laugh me to scorn if you please;&mdash;call me your “frog-in-the-well”:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flowers fall into my well; and its water mirrors the moon!<br /></span></i>
</div></div>

<p>The second poem is supposed to be the utterance
of a woman having good reason to be jealous:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<i><span class="i0">Dull as a stagnant pond you deemed the mind of your mistress;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the stagnant pond can speak: you shall hear the cry of the frog!<br /></span></i>
</div></div>

<p>Outside of love-poems there are hundreds of
verses about the common frogs of ponds or ricefields.
Some refer chiefly to the volume of the
sound that the frogs make:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Hearing the frogs of the ricefields, methinks that the water sings.</i><br /></span>
</div>
</div>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>As we flush the ricefields of spring, the frog-song flows with the water.</i><br /></span>
</div>
</div>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>From ricefield to ricefield they call: unceasing the challenge and answer.</i><br /></span>
</div>
</div>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Ever as deepens the night, louder the chorus of pond-frogs.</i><br /></span>
</div>
</div>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>So many the voices of frogs that I cannot but wonder if the pond be not wider at night than by day!</i><br /></span>
</div>
</div>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Even the rowing boats can scarce proceed, so thick the clamor of the frogs of Horié!</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The exaggeration of the last verse is of course
intentional, and in the original not uneffective.
In some parts of the world&mdash;in the marshes of
Florida and of southern Louisiana, for example,&mdash;the
clamor of the frogs at certain seasons
resembles the roaring of a furious sea; and
whoever has heard it can appreciate the fancy
of sound as obstacle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>Other poems compare or associate the sound
made by frogs with the sound of rain:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>The song of the earliest frogs,&mdash;fainter than falling of rain.</i><br /></span>
</div>
</div>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>What I took for the falling of rain is only the singing of frogs.</i><br /></span>
</div>
</div>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Now I shall dream, lulled by the patter of rain and the song of the frogs.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Other poems, again, are intended only as tiny
pictures,&mdash;thumb-nail sketches,&mdash;such as this
<i>hokku</i>,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Path between ricefields; frogs jumping away to right and left</i>;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&mdash;or this, which is a thousand years old:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Where the flowers of the yamabuki are imaged in the still marsh-water, the voice of the kawazu is heard</i>;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&mdash;or the following pretty fancy:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Now sings the frog, and the voice of the frog is perfumed;&mdash;for into the shining stream the cherry-petals fall.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>
<p>The last two pieces refer, of course, to the true
singing frog.</p>

<p>Many short poems are addressed directly to the
frog itself,&mdash;whether kaeru or kajika. There are
poems of melancholy, of affection, of humor, of
religion, and even of philosophy among these.
Sometimes the frog is likened to a spirit resting
on a lotos-leaf; sometimes, to a priest repeating
sûtras for the sake of the dying flowers; sometimes
to a pining lover; sometimes to a host
receiving travellers; sometimes to a blasphemer,
“always beginning” to say something against
the gods, but always afraid to finish it. Most of
the following examples are taken from the recent
book of frog-poems published by Roséki;&mdash;each
paragraph of my prose rendering, it should
be remembered, represents a distinct poem:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Now all the guests being gone, why still thus respectfully sitting, O frog?</i><br /></span>
</div>
</div>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>So resting your hands on the ground, do you welcome the Rain, O frog?</i><br /></span>
</div>
</div>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>You disturb in the ancient well the light of the stars, O frog!</i><br /></span>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Sleepy the sound of the rain; but your voice
makes me dream, O frog!</i></span>
</div>
</div>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Always beginning to say something against
the great Heaven, O frog!</i></span>
</div>
</div>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>You have learned that the world is void: you
never look at it as you float, O frog!</i></span>
</div>
</div>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Having lived in clear-rushing mountain-streams,
never can your voice become stagnant,
O frog!</i></span></div>
</div>

<p>The last pleasing conceit shows the esteem in
which the superior vocal powers of the kajika are
held.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>I thought it strange that out of hundreds of
frog-poems collected for me I could not discover
a single mention of the coldness and clamminess
of the frog. Except a few jesting lines about the
queer attitudes sometimes assumed by the creature,
the only reference to its uninviting qualities
that I could find was the mild remark,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Seen in the daytime, how uninteresting you
are, O frog!</i></span></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>While wondering at this reticence concerning the
chilly, slimy, flaccid nature of frogs, it all at once
occurred to me that in other thousands of Japanese
poems which I had read there was a total
absence of allusions to tactual sensations. Sensations
of colors, sounds, and odors were rendered
with exquisite and surprising delicacy; but sensations
of taste were seldom mentioned, and
sensations of touch were absolutely ignored. I
asked myself whether the reason for this reticence
or indifference should be sought in the particular
temperament or mental habit of the race; but I
have not yet been able to decide the question.
Remembering that the race has been living for
ages upon food which seems tasteless to the
Western palate, and that impulses to such action
as hand-clasping, embracing, kissing, or other
physical display of affectionate feeling, are really
foreign to far-Eastern character, one is tempted to
the theory that gustatory and tactual sensations,
pleasurable and otherwise, have been less highly
evolved with the Japanese than with us. But
there is much evidence against such a theory; and
the triumphs of Japanese handicraft assure us of
an almost incomparable delicacy of touch developed
in special directions. Whatever be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
physiological meaning of the phenomenon, its
moral meaning is of most importance. So far as
I have been able to judge, Japanese poetry usually
ignores the inferior qualities of sensation, while
making the subtlest of appeals to those superior
qualities which we call æsthetic. Even if representing
nothing else, this fact represents the
healthiest and happiest attitude toward Nature.
Do not we Occidentals shrink from many purely
natural impressions by reason of repulsion developed
through a morbid tactual sensibility? The
question is at least worth considering. Ignoring
or mastering such repulsion,&mdash;accepting naked
Nature as she is, always lovable when understood,&mdash;the
Japanese discover beauty where we blindly
imagine ugliness or formlessness or loathsomeness,&mdash;beauty
in insects, beauty in stones, beauty in
frogs. Is the fact without significance that they
alone have been able to make artistic use of the
form of the centipede?... You should see my
Kyōtō tobacco-pouch, with centipedes of gold
running over its figured leather like ripplings of
fire!</p>

<h3>Of Moon-Desire</h3>

<div class="figcenter nobreak" style="width: 46px;">
<img src="images/zillchapterheading.png" width="46" height="50" alt="decoration" />
</div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>He was two years old when&mdash;as ordained in
the law of perpetual recurrence&mdash;he
asked me for the Moon.</p>

<p>Unwisely I protested,&mdash;</p>

<p>“The Moon I cannot give you because it is too
high up. I cannot reach it.”</p>

<p>He answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>“By taking a very long bamboo, you probably
could reach it, and knock it down.”</p>

<p>I said,&mdash;</p>

<p>“There is no bamboo long enough.”</p>

<p>He suggested:&mdash;</p>

<p>“By standing on the ridge of the roof of the
house, you probably could poke it with the
bamboo.”</p>

<p>&mdash;Whereat I found myself constrained to make
some approximately truthful statements concerning
the nature and position of the Moon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>This set me thinking. I thought about the
strange fascination that brightness exerts upon
living creatures in general,&mdash;upon insects and
fishes and birds and mammals,&mdash;and tried to
account for it by some inherited memory of
brightness as related to food, to water, and to
freedom. I thought of the countless generations
of children who have asked for the Moon, and of
the generations of parents who have laughed at
the asking. And then I entered into the following
meditation:&mdash;</p>

<p class="tbpara">Have we any right to laugh at the child’s wish
for the Moon? No wish could be more natural;
and as for its incongruity,&mdash;do not we, children
of a larger growth, mostly nourish wishes quite as
innocent,&mdash;longings that if realized could only
work us woe,&mdash;such as desire for the continuance
after death of that very sense-life, or individuality,
which once deluded us all into wanting
to play with the Moon, and often subsequently
deluded us in far less pleasant ways?</p>

<p>Now foolish as may seem, to merely empirical
reasoning, the wish of the child for the Moon, I
have an idea that the highest wisdom commands
us to wish for very much more than the Moon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>&mdash;even
for more than the Sun and the Morning-Star
and all the Host of Heaven.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>I remember when a boy lying on my back in
the grass, gazing into the summer blue above me,
and wishing that I could melt into it,&mdash;become
a part of it. For these fancies I believe that a
religious tutor was innocently responsible: he had
tried to explain to me, because of certain dreamy
questions, what he termed “the folly and the
wickedness of pantheism,”&mdash;with the result that
I immediately became a pantheist, at the tender
age of fifteen. And my imaginings presently led
me not only to want the sky for a playground,
but also to become the sky!</p>

<p>Now I think that in those days I was really
close to a great truth,&mdash;touching it, in fact, without
the faintest suspicion of its existence. I mean
the truth that the wish <i>to become</i> is reasonable in
direct ratio to its largeness,&mdash;or, in other words,
that the more you wish to be, the wiser you are;
while the wish <i>to have</i> is apt to be foolish in
proportion to its largeness. Cosmic law permits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
us very few of the countless things that we wish
to have, but will help us to become all that we
can possibly wish to be. Finite, and in so much
feeble, is the wish to have: but infinite in puissance
is the wish to become; and every mortal
wish to become must eventually find satisfaction.
By wanting to be, the monad makes itself the
elephant, the eagle, or the man. By wanting to
be, the man should become a god. Perhaps on
this tiny globe, lighted only by a tenth-rate yellow
sun, he will not have time to become a god;
but who dare assert that his wish cannot project
itself to mightier systems illuminated by vaster
suns, and there reshape and invest him with the
forms and powers of divinity? Who dare even
say that his wish may not expand him beyond
the Limits of Form, and make him one with
Omnipotence? And Omnipotence, without asking,
can have much brighter and bigger play-things
than the Moon.</p>

<p>Probably everything is a mere question of wishing,&mdash;providing
that we wish, not to have, but to
be. Most of the sorrow of life certainly exists
because of the wrong kind of wishing and because
of the contemptible pettiness of the wishes. Even
to wish for the absolute lordship and possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
of the entire earth were a pitifully small and
vulgar wish. We must learn to nourish very
much bigger wishes than that! My faith is that
we must wish to become the total universe with
its thousands of millions of worlds,&mdash;and more
than the universe, or a myriad universes,&mdash;and
more even than Space and Time.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>Possibly the power for such wishing must
depend upon our comprehension of the ghostliness
of substance. Once men endowed with
spirit all forms and motions and utterances of
Nature: stone and metal, herb and tree, cloud
and wind,&mdash;the lights of heaven, the murmuring
of leaves and waters, the echoes of the hills,
the tumultuous speech of the sea. Then becoming
wiser in their own conceit, they likewise became
of little faith; and they talked about “the
Inanimate” and “the Inert,”&mdash;which are nonexistent,&mdash;and
discoursed of Force as distinct
from Matter, and of Mind as distinct from both.
Yet we now discover that the primitive fancies
were, after all, closer to probable truth. We can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>not
indeed think of Nature to-day precisely as did
our forefathers; but we find ourselves obliged to
think of her in very much weirder ways; and
the later revelations of our science have revitalized
not a little of the primitive thought, and infused
it with a new and awful beauty. And meantime
those old savage sympathies with savage Nature
that spring from the deepest sources of our being,&mdash;always
growing with our growth, strengthening
with our strength, more and more unfolding
with the evolution of our higher sensibilities,&mdash;would
seem destined to sublime at last into forms
of cosmical emotion expanding and responding
to infinitude.</p>

<p class="tbpara">Have you never thought about those immemorial
feelings?... Have you never, when
looking at some great burning, found yourself
exulting without remorse in the triumph and glory
of fire?&mdash;never unconsciously coveted the crumbling,
splitting, iron-wrenching, granite-cracking
force of its imponderable touch?&mdash;never delighted
in the furious and terrible splendor of its
phantasmagories,&mdash;the ravening and bickering
of its dragons,&mdash;the monstrosity of its archings,&mdash;the
ghostly soaring and flapping of its spires?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Have you never, with a hill-wind pealing in your
ears, longed to ride that wind like a ghost,&mdash;to
scream round the peaks with it,&mdash;to sweep the
face of the world with it? Or, watching the
lifting, the gathering, the muttering rush and
thunder-burst of breakers, have you felt no impulse
kindred to that giant motion,&mdash;no longing
to leap with that wild white tossing, and to join
in that mighty shout?... And all such ancient
emotional sympathies with Nature’s familiar
forces&mdash;do they not prelude, with their modern
æsthetic developments, the future growth of rarer
sympathies with incomparably subtler forces, and
of longings to be limited only by our power to
know? Know ether&mdash;shivering from star to
star;&mdash;comprehend its sensitivities, its penetrancies,
its transmutations;&mdash;and sympathies ethereal
will evolve. Know the forces that spin the
suns;&mdash;and already the way has been reached of
becoming one with them.</p>

<p>And furthermore, is there no suggestion of such
evolvement in the steady widening through all the
centuries of the thoughts of their world-priests
and poets?&mdash;in the later sense of Life-as-Unity
absorbing or transforming the ancient childish
sense of life-personal?&mdash;in the tone of the new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
rapture in world-beauty, dominating the elder
worship of beauty-human?&mdash;in the larger modern
joy evoked by the blossoming of dawns, the
blossoming of stars,&mdash;by all quiverings of color,
all shudderings of light? And is not the thing-in-itself,
the detail, the appearance, being ever less
and less studied for its mere power to charm, and
ever more and more studied as a single character
in that Infinite Riddle of which all phenomena
are but ideographs?</p>

<p class="tbpara">Nay!&mdash;surely the time must come when we
shall desire to be all that is, all that ever has been
known,&mdash;the past and the present and the future
in one,&mdash;all feeling, striving, thinking, joying,
sorrowing,&mdash;and everywhere the Part,&mdash;and
everywhere the Whole. And before us, with the
waxing of the wish, perpetually the Infinities shall
widen.</p>

<p>And I&mdash;even I!&mdash;by virtue of that wish,
shall become all forms, all forces, all conditions:
Ether, Wind, Fire, Water, Earth,&mdash;all motion
visible or viewless,&mdash;all vibration named of light,
of color, of sonority, of torrefaction,&mdash;all thrillings
piercing substance,&mdash;all oscillations picturing
in blackness, like the goblin-vision of the X-rays.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
By virtue of that wish I shall become the Source
of all becoming and of all ceasing,&mdash;the Power
that shapes, the Power that dissolves,&mdash;creating,
with the shadows of my sleep, the life that shall
vanish with my wakening. And even as phosphor-lampings
in currents of midnight sea, so
shall shimmer and pulse and pass, in mine Ocean
of Death and Birth, the burning of billions of
suns, the whirling of trillions of worlds....</p>

<p>&mdash;“Well,” said the friend to whom I read this
revery, “there is some Buddhism in your fancies&mdash;though
you seem to have purposely avoided
several important points of doctrine. For instance,
you must know that Nirvana is never to
be reached by wishing, but by <i>not</i> wishing. What
you call the ‘wish-to-become’ can only help us,
like a lantern, along the darker portions of the
Way. As for wanting the Moon&mdash;I think that
you must have seen many old Japanese pictures
of apes clutching at the reflection of the Moon in
water. The subject is a Buddhist parable: the
water is the phantom-flux of sensations and ideas;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the Moon&mdash;not its distorted image&mdash;is the sole
Truth. And your Western philosopher was really
teaching a Buddhist parable when he proclaimed
man but a higher kind of ape. For in this
world of illusion, man is truly still the ape, trying
to seize on water the shadow of the Moon.”</p>

<p>&mdash;“Ape indeed,” I made answer,&mdash;“but an
ape of gods,&mdash;even that divine Ape of the
Ramayana who may clutch the Sun!”</p>

<h4>I</h4>

<p>I wonder why the emblematical significance
of the Composite Photograph has been so
little considered by the philosophers of evolution.
In the blending and coalescing of the
shadows that make it, is there no suggestion of
that bioplasmic chemistry which, out of the intermingling
of innumerable lives, crystallizes the
composite of personality? Has the superimposition
of images upon the sensitized plate no likeness
to those endless superimpositions of heredity
out of which every individuality must shape itself?...
Surely it is a very weird thing, this
Composite Photograph,&mdash;and hints of things
weirder.</p>

<p class="tbpara">Every human face is a living composite of
countless faces,&mdash;generations and generations of
faces superimposed upon the sensitive film of Life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
for the great cosmic developing process. And
any living face, well watched by love or by hate,
will reveal the fact. The face of friend or sweetheart
has a hundred different aspects; and you
know that you want, when his or her “likeness”
is taken, to insist upon the reflection of the
dearest of these. The face of your enemy,&mdash;no
matter what antipathy it may excite,&mdash;is not invariably
hateful in itself: you must acknowledge,
to yourself at least, having observed in it moments
of an expression the reverse of unworthy.</p>

<p>Probably the ancestral types that try to reproduce
themselves in the modulations of facial
expression, are nearly always the more recent;&mdash;the
very ancient having become metamorphosed,
under weight of superimposition, into a blank
underlying vagueness,&mdash;a mere protoplasmic
background out of which, except in rare and
monstrous cases, no outline can detach itself.
But in every normal face whole generations of
types do certainly, by turns of mood, make flitting
apparition. Any mother knows this. Studying
day by day the features of her child, she
finds in them variations not to be explained by
simple growth. Sometimes there is a likeness to
one parent or grandparent; sometimes a likeness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
to another, or to remoter kindred; and at rarer
intervals may appear peculiarities of expression
that no member of the family can account for.
(Thus, in darker centuries, the ghastly superstition
of the “changeling,” was not only possible,
but in a certain sense quite natural.) Through
youth and manhood and far into old age these
mutations continue,&mdash;though always more slowly
and faintly,&mdash;even while the general characteristics
steadily accentuate; and death itself may
bring into the countenance some strange expression
never noticed during life.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>As a rule we recognize faces by the modes
of expression habitually worn,&mdash;by the usually
prevalent character-tones of them,&mdash;rather than
by any steady memory of lines. But no face at all
moments remains exactly the same; and in cases
of exceptional variability the expression does not
suffice for recognition: we have to look for some
fixed peculiarity, some minute superficial detail
independent of physiognomy. All expression has
but a relative permanency: even in faces the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
most strongly marked, its variations may defy
estimate. Perhaps the mobility is, within certain
limits, in direct ratio to irregularity of feature;&mdash;any
approach to ideal beauty being also an approach
to relative fixity. At all events, the more
familiar we become with any common face, the
more astonishing the multitude of the transformations
we observe in it,&mdash;the more indescribable
and bewildering its fugitive subtleties of
expression. And what are these but the ebb and
flow of life ancestral,&mdash;under-ripplings in that
well-spring unfathomable of personality whose
flood is Soul. Perpetually beneath the fluid tissues
of flesh the dead are moulding and moving&mdash;not
singly (for in no phenomenon is there any
singleness), but in currents and by surgings.
Sometimes there is an eddying of ghosts of love;
and the face dawns as if a sunrise lighted it.
Sometimes there is a billowing up of ghosts of
hate; and the face darkens and distorts like an
evil dream,&mdash;and we say to the mind behind it,
“You are not now <i>your better self</i>.” But that
which we call the self, whether the better or the
worse, is a complexity forever shifting the order
of its combinations. According to stimulus of
hope or fear, of joy or pain, there must vibrate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
within every being, at differing rhythms, with
varying oscillation, incalculable tremulosities of
ancestral life. In the calmest normal existence
slumber all the psychical tones of the past,&mdash;from
the lurid red of primal sense-impulse to the violet
of spiritual aspiration,&mdash;even as all known
colours sleep in white light. And over the sensitive
living mask, at each strong alternation of the
psychical currents, flit shadowy resurrections of
dead expression.</p>

<p>Seeing faces and their changes, we learn intuitively
the relation to our own selves of the
selves that confront us. In very few cases could
we even try to explain how this knowledge
comes,&mdash;how we reach those conclusions called,
in common parlance, “first impressions.” Faces
are not <i>read</i>. The impressions they give are
only <i>felt</i>, and have much of the same vague
character as impressions of sound,&mdash;making
within us mental states either pleasant or unpleasant
or somewhat of both,&mdash;evoking now
a sense of danger, now a melting sympathy, occasionally
a gentle sadness. And these impressions,
though seldom at fault, cannot be very
well explained in words. The reasons of their
accuracy are likewise the reasons of their mys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>tery,&mdash;reasons
not to be discovered in the narrow
range of our personal experience,&mdash;reasons
very, very much older than we. Could we
remember our former lives, we should know
more exactly the meaning of our likes and our
dislikes. For the truth is that they are superindividual.
It is not the individual eye that perceives
everything perceived in a face. The dead
are the real seers. But as they remain unable to
guide us otherwise than by touching the chords
of mental pleasure or pain, we can feel the relative
meaning of faces only in a dim, though
powerful way.</p>

<p>Instinctively, at least, superindividuality is commonly
recognized. Hence such phrases as “force
of character,” “moral force,” “personal fascination,”
“personal magnetism,” and others showing
that the influence exerted by man upon man is
known to be independent of mere physical conditions.
Very insignificant bodies have that within
them by which formidable bodies are mastered
and directed. The flesh-and-blood man is only
the visible end of an invisible column of force
reaching out of the infinite past into the momentary
present,&mdash;only the material Symbol of an
immaterial host. A contest between even two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
wills is a contest of phantom armies. The domination
of many personalities by the simple will
of one,&mdash;hinting the perception by the compelled
of superior viewless powers behind the compeller,&mdash;is
never to be interpreted by the old hypothesis
of soul-equality. Only by scientific psychology
can the mystery of certain formidable characters
be even partly explained; but any explanation
must rest upon the acceptance, in some form or
other, of the immense evolutional fact of psychical
inheritance. And psychical inheritance signifies
the super-individual,&mdash;pre-existence revived
in compound personality.</p>

<p>Yet, from our ethical standpoint, that super-individuality
which we thus unconsciously allow
in the very language used to express psychical
domination, is a lower manifestation. Though
working often for good, the power in itself is of
evil; and the recognition of it by the subjugated
is not a recognition of higher moral energy, but
of a higher <i>mental</i> energy signifying larger evolutional
experience of wrong, deeper reserves of
aggressive ingenuity, heavier capacities for the
giving of pain. Called by no matter what euphemistic
name, such power is brutal in its origin,
and still allied to those malignities and ferocities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
shared by man with lower predatory creatures.
But the beauty of the superindividual is revealed
in that rarer power which the dead lend the living
to win trust, to inspire ideals, to create love, to
brighten whole circles of existence with the charm
and wonder of a personality never to be described
save in the language of light and music.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>Now if we could photographically <i>decompose</i> a
composite photograph so as to separate in order
inverse all the impressions interblended to make
it, such process would clumsily represent what
really happens when the image of a strange face
is telegraphed back&mdash;like a police-photograph&mdash;from
the living retina to the mysterious offices of
inherited memory. There, with the quickness of
an electric flash, the shadow-face is decomposed
into all the ancestral types combined in it; and
the resulting verdict of the dead, though rendered
only by indefinable sensation, is more trustworthy
than any written certificate of character could ever
be. But its trustworthiness is limited to the
<i>potential</i> relation of the individual seen to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
individual seeing. Upon different minds, according
to the delicate balance of personality,&mdash;according
to the qualitative sum of inherited
experience in the psychical composition of the
observer,&mdash;the same features will make very
different impressions. A face that strongly
repels one person may not less strongly attract
another, and will produce nearly similar impressions
only on groups of emotionally homogeneous
natures. Certainly the fact of this ability to
discern in the composition of faces that indefinable
something which welcomes or which warns,
does suggest the possibility of deciding some
laws of ethical physiognomy; but such laws
would necessarily be of a very general and simple
kind, and their relative value could never equal
that of the uneducated personal intuition.</p>

<p>How, indeed, should it be otherwise? What
science could ever hope to measure the infinite
possibilities of psychical combination? And the
present in every countenance is a recombination
of the past;&mdash;the living is always a resurrection
of the dead. The sympathies and the fears,
the hopes and the repulsions that faces inspire,
are but revivals and reiterations,&mdash;echoes of sentiency
created in millions of minds by immeasur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>able
experience operating through immeasurable
time. My friend of this hour, though no more
identical with his forefathers than any single
ripple of a current is identical with all the ripples
that ever preceded it, is nevertheless by soul-composition
one with myriads known and loved
in other lands and in other lives,&mdash;in times
recorded and in times forgotten,&mdash;in cities that
still remain and in cities that have ceased to be,&mdash;by
thousands of my vanished selves.</p>

<h3>Beauty is Memory</h3>

<div class="figcenter nobreak" style="width: 46px;">
<img src="images/zillchapterheading.png" width="46" height="50" alt="decoration" />
</div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>When you first saw her your heart leaped,
and a tingling shocked through all
your blood like a gush of electricity.
Simultaneously your senses were changed, and
long so remained.</p>

<p>That sudden throb was the awakening of your
dead;&mdash;and that thrill was made by the swarming
and the crowding of them;&mdash;and that change
of sense was wrought only by their multitudinous
desire,&mdash;for which reason it seemed <i>an intensification</i>.
They remembered having loved a number
of young persons somewhat resembling her.
But where, or when, they did not recollect. They&mdash;(and
They, of course, are You)&mdash;had drunk
of Lethe many times since then.</p>

<p>The true name of the River of Forgetfulness is
the River of Death&mdash;though you may not find
authority for the statement in classical dictionaries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
But the Greek story, that the waters of Lethe
bring to weary souls oblivion of the past, is not
quite true. One draught will indeed numb and
becloud some forms of memory,&mdash;will efface the
remembrance of dates and names and of other
trifling details;&mdash;but a million draughts will not
produce total oblivion. Even the destruction of
the world would not have that result. <i>Nothing
is absolutely forgotten except the non-essential.</i>
The essential can, at most, only be dimmed by
the drinking of Lethe.</p>

<p>It was because of billions of billions of memories
amassed through trillions of lives, and blended
within you into some one vague delicious image,
that you came to believe a certain being more
beautiful than the sun. The delusion signified
that she happened to resemble this composite,&mdash;mnemonic
shadowing of all the dead women
related to the loves of your innumerable lives.
And this first part of your experience, when you
could not understand,&mdash;when you fancied the
beloved a witch, and never even dreamed that
the witchery might be the work of ghosts, was&mdash;the
Period of Wonder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>Wonder at what? At the power and mystery
of beauty. (For whether only within yourself,
or partly within and partly outside of yourself, it
was beauty that you saw, and that made you
wonder.) But you will now remember that the
beloved seemed lovelier than mortal woman really
could be;&mdash;and the how and the why of that
seeming are questions of interest.</p>

<p class="tbpara">With the power to see beauty we are born&mdash;somewhat,
though not altogether, as we are born
with the power to perceive color. Most human
beings are able to discern something of beauty,
or at least of approach to beauty&mdash;though the
volume of the faculty varies in different individuals
more than the volume of a mountain varies
from that of a grain of sand. There are men
born blind; but the normal being inherits some
ideal of beauty. It may be vivid or it may be
vague; but in every case it represents an accumulation
of countless impressions received by the
race,&mdash;countless fragments, of prenatal remembrance
crystallized into one composite image<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
within organic memory, where, like the viewless
image on a photographic plate awaiting development,
it remains awhile in darkness absolute.
And just because it is a composite of numberless
race-memories of individual attraction, this ideal
necessarily represents, in the superior mind, a
something above the existing possible,&mdash;something
never to be realized, much less surpassed, in
the present state of humanity.</p>

<p>And what is the relation of this composite,
fairer than human possibility, to the illusion of
love? If it be permissible to speak one’s imagining
of the unimaginable, I can dare a theory.
When, in the hour of the ripeness of youth,
there is perceived some objective comeliness
faintly corresponding to certain outlines of the
inherited ideal, at once a wave of emotion ancestral
bathes the long-darkened image, defines it,
illuminates it,&mdash;and so deludes the senses;&mdash;for
the sense-reflection of the living objective becomes
temporarily blended with the subjective phantasm,&mdash;with
the beautiful luminous ghost made
of centillions of memories. Thus to the lover
the common suddenly becomes the impossible,
because he really perceives blended with it the
superindividual and superhuman. He is much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
too deeply bewitched by that supernatural to be
persuaded of his illusion, by any reasoning.
What conquers his will is not the magic of
anything living or tangible, but a charm sinuous
and fugitive and light as fire,&mdash;a spectral snare
prepared for him by myriads unthinkable of
generations of dead.</p>

<p class="tbpara">So much and no more of theory I venture as
to the <i>how</i> of the riddle. But what of the <i>why</i>,&mdash;the
reason of the emotion made by this ghostly
beauty revived out of the measureless past?
What should beauty have to do with a superindividual
ecstasy older than all æsthetic feeling?
What is the evolutional secret of the fascination
of beauty?</p>

<p>I think that an answer can be given. But it
will involve the fullest acceptance of this truth:&mdash;<i>There
is no such thing as beauty-in-itself.</i></p>

<p>All the riddles and contradictions of our æsthetic
systems are natural consequences of the delusion
that beauty is a something absolute, a transcendental
reality, an eternal fact. It is true that the
appearance we call beauty is the symbol of a
fact,&mdash;is the visible manifestation of a development
beyond the ordinary,&mdash;a bodily evolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
more advanced than the existing average. In like
manner what we call grace is a real manifestation
of the economy of force. But since there can be
no cosmic limit to evolutional possibilities, there
never can be any standards of grace or of beauty
that are not relative and essentially transitory;
and there can be no physical ideals,&mdash;not even
Greek ideals,&mdash;that might not in the course of
human evolution or of superhuman evolution be
so much more than realized as to become vulgarities
of form. An ultimate of beauty is inconceivable
and impossible; no term of æsthetics can
ever represent more than the idea of a phase of
the perpetual becoming, a temporary relation in
comparative evolution. Beauty-in-itself is only
the name of a sensation, or complex of sensation,
mistaken for objectivity&mdash;much as sound and
light and color were once imagined to be realities.</p>

<p>Yet what is it that attracts?&mdash;what is the meaning
of the resistless emotion which we call the
Sense of Beauty?</p>

<p>Like the sensing of light or color or perfume,
the recognition of beauty is a recognition of fact.
But that fact bears to the feeling evoked no more
likeness than the reality of five hundred billions of
ether-shiverings per second bears to the sensation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
of orange. Still in either case the fact is a manifestation
of force. Representing higher evolution,
the phenomenon termed beauty also represents a
relatively superior fitness for life, a higher ability to
fulfil the conditions of existence; and it is the non-conscious
perception of this representation that
makes the fascination. The longing aroused is not
for any mere abstraction, but for greater completeness
of faculty as means to the natural end. To
the dead within each man, beauty signifies the
presence of what they need most,&mdash;Power. They
know, in despite of Lethe, that when they lived in
comely bodies life was usually made easy and
happy for them, and that when prisoned in feeble
or in ugly bodies, they found life miserable or
difficult. They want to live many times again in
sound young bodies,&mdash;in shapes that assure force,
health, joy, quickness to win and energy to keep
the best prizes of life’s contest. They want, if
possible, conditions better than any of the past,
but in no event conditions worse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>And so the Riddle resolves itself as Memory,&mdash;immeasurable
Memory of all bodily fitness for
the ends of life: a Composite glorified, doubtless,
by some equally measureless inherited sense of
all the vanished joys ever associated with such
fitness.</p>

<p>Infinite, may we not term it&mdash;this Composite?
Aye, but not merely because the multitudes of
dead memories that make it are unspeakable.
Equally unspeakable the width and the depth of
the range of them throughout the enormity of
Time.... O lover, how slender the beautiful
witch,&mdash;the ghost within the ghost of you! Yet
the depth of that ghost is the depth of the Nebulous
Zone bespanning Night,&mdash;the luminous
Shadow that Egypt figured of old as Mother of
the Sun and the Gods, curving her long white
woman’s-body over the world. As a vapor of
phosphorus, or wake of a ship in the night,&mdash;only
so with naked eye can we behold it. But
pierced by vision telescopic, it is revealed as the
further side of the Ring of the Cosmos,&mdash;dim belt
of millions of suns seemingly massed together like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
the cells of a living body, yet so seeming only by
reason of their frightful remoteness. Even thus
really separated each from each in the awfulness
of the Night of Time,&mdash;by silent profundities of
centuries,&mdash;by interspaces of thousands and of
myriads of years,&mdash;though collectively shaping
to love’s desire but one dim soft sweet phantom,&mdash;are
those million-swarming memories that
make for youth its luminous dream of beauty.</p>

<h3>Sadness in Beauty</h3>


<p>The poet who sang that beautiful things
bring sadness, named as beautiful things
music and sunset and night, clear skies
and transparent waters. Their sadness he sought
to explain by vague soul-memories of Paradise.
Very old-fashioned this explanation; but it contains
a shadowing of truth. For the mysterious
sadness associated with the sense of beauty is
certainly not of this existence, but of countless
anterior lives,&mdash;and therefore indeed a sadness
of reminiscence.</p>

<p>Elsewhere I try to explain why certain qualities
of music, and certain aspects of sunset produce
sadness, and even more than sadness. As for
impressions of night, however, I doubt if the
emotion that night evokes in this nineteenth century
can be classed with the sadness that beauty
brings. A wonderful night,&mdash;a tropical night,
for instance, lucent and lukewarm, with a new
moon in it, curved and yellow like a ripe banana,&mdash;may
inspire, among other minor feelings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
something of tenderness; but the great dominant
emotion evoked by the splendor of the vision is
not sadness. Breaking open the heavens to their
highest, night widens modern thought over the
bounds of life and death by the spectacle of that
Infinite whose veil is day. Night also forces
remembrance of the mystery of our tether,&mdash;the
viewless force that holds us down to this
wretched little ball of a world. And the result is
cosmic emotion&mdash;vaster than any sense of the
sublime,&mdash;drowning all other emotion,&mdash;but
nowise akin to the sadness that beauty causes.
Anciently the emotion of night must have been
incomparably less voluminous. Men who believed
the sky to be a solid vault, never could
have felt, as we feel it, the stupendous pomp of
darkness. And our ever-growing admiration
of those awful astral questions in the Book of
Job, is mainly due to the fact that, with the progress
of science, they continue to make larger
and larger appeal to forms of thought and feeling
which never could have entered into the mind
of Job.</p>

<p>But the sadness excited by the beauty of a perfect
day, or by the charm of nature in her
brightest moods, is a fact of another kind, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
needs a different explanation. Inherited the feeling
must be,&mdash;but through what cumulation of
ancestral pain? Why should the tenderness of
an unclouded sky, the soft green sleep of summered
valleys, the murmurous peace of sun-flecked
shadows, inspire us with sadness? Why
should any inherited emotion following an
æsthetic perception be melancholy rather than
joyous?... Of course I do not refer to the
sense of vastness or permanence or power aroused
by the sight of the sea, or by any vision of sea-like
space, or by the majesty of colossal ranges.
That is the feeling of the sublime,&mdash;always
related to fear. Æsthetic sadness is related rather
to desire.</p>

<p class="tbpara">“All beautiful things bring sadness,” is a statement
as near to truth as most general statements;
but the sadness and its evolutional history must
vary according to circumstances. The melancholy
awakened by the sight of a beautiful face
cannot be identical with that awakened by the
sight of a landscape, by the hearing of music,
or by the reading of a poem. Yet there should
be some one emotional element common to
æsthetic sadness,&mdash;one general kind of feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
which would help us to solve the riddle of the
melancholy inspired by the sight of beauty in
Nature. Such a common element, I believe, is
inherited longing,&mdash;inherited dim sense of loss,
shadowed and qualified variously by interrelated
feelings. Different forms of this inheritance
would be awakened by different impressions of
the beautiful. In the case of human beauty, the
æsthetic recognition might be toned or shadowed
by immemorial inheritance of pain&mdash;pain of
longing, and pain of separation from numberless
forgotten beloved. In the case of a color, a
melody, an effect of sunshine or of moonlight,
the sense-impressions appealing to æsthetic feeling
might equally appeal to various ancestral memories
of pain. The melancholy given by the sight
of a beautiful landscape is certainly a melancholy
of longing,&mdash;a sadness massive as vague, because
made by the experience of millions of our dead.</p>

<p>“The æsthetic feeling for nature in its purity,”
declares Sully, “is a modern growth ... the feeling
for nature’s wild solitudes is hardly older than
Rousseau.” Perhaps to many this will seem rather
a strong statement in regard to the races of the
West;&mdash;it is not true of the races of the Far East,
whose art and poetry yield ancient proof to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
contrary. But no evolutionist would deny that
the æsthetic love of nature has been developed
through civilization, and that many abstract sentiments
now involved with it are of very recent
origin. Much of the sadness made in us by the
sight of a beautiful landscape would therefore be
of comparatively modern growth, though less
modern than some of the higher qualities of
æsthetic pleasure which accompany the emotion.
I surmise it to be mainly the inherited pain of
that separation from Nature which began with the
building of walled cities. Possibly there is blended
with it something of incomparably older sorrow&mdash;such
as the immemorial mourning of man
for the death of summer; but this, and other
feelings inherited from ages of wandering, would
revive more especially in the great vague melancholy
that autumn brings into what we still call
our souls.</p>

<p class="tbpara">Ever as the world increasing its wisdom increases
its sorrow, our dwellers in cities built up
to heaven more and more regret the joys of humanity’s
childhood,&mdash;the ancient freedom of
forest and peak and plain, the brightness of
mountain water, the cool keen sweetness of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
sea’s breath and the thunder-roll of its eternal
epic. And all this regret of civilization for Nature
irretrievably forsaken, may somehow revive
in that great soft dim sadness which the beauty
of a landscape makes us feel.</p>

<p>In one sense we are certainly wrong when we
say that the loveliness of a scene brings tears to
the eyes. It cannot be the loveliness of the scene;&mdash;it
is the longing of generations quickening
in the hearts of us. The beauty we speak of
has no real existence: the emotion of the dead
alone makes it seem to be,&mdash;the emotion of
those long-buried millions of men and women
who loved Nature for reasons very much simpler
and older than any æsthetic emotion is. To the
windows of the house of life their phantoms
crowd,&mdash;like prisoners toward some vision of
bright skies and flying birds, free hills and glimmering
streams, beyond the iron of their bars.
They behold their desire of other time,&mdash;the
vast light and space of the world, the wind-swept
clearness of azure, the hundred greens of
wold and plain, the spectral promise of summits
far away. They hear the shrilling and the whirr
of happy winged things, the chorus of cicada and
bird, the lisping and laughing of water, the under-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>tone
of leafage astir. They know the smell of
the season&mdash;all sharp sweet odors of sap, scents
of flower and fruitage. They feel the quickening
of the living air,&mdash;the thrilling of the great
Blue Ghost.</p>

<p>But all this comes to them, filtered through the
bars and veils of their rebirth, only as dreams of
home to hopeless exile,&mdash;of child-bliss to desolate
age,&mdash;of remembered vision to the blind!</p>

<h3>Parfum de Jeunesse</h3>


<p>“I remember,”&mdash;said an old friend, telling
me the romance of his youth,&mdash;“that I
could always find her cloak in the cloak-room
without a light, when it was time to take
her home. I used to know it in the dark, because
it had the smell of sweet new milk....”</p>

<p>Which set me somehow to thinking of English
dawns, the scent of hayfields, the fragrance of
hawthorn days;&mdash;and cluster after cluster of
memories lighted up in succession through a
great arc of remembrance that flashed over half
a lifetime even before my friend’s last words had
ceased to sound in my ears. And then recollection
smouldered into revery,&mdash;a revery about the
riddle of the odor of youth.</p>

<p class="tbpara">That quality of the <i>parfum de jeunesse</i> which
my friend described is not uncommon,&mdash;though
I fancy that it belongs to Northern rather than to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Southern races. It signifies perfect health and
splendid vigor. But there are other and more
delicate varieties of the attraction. Sometimes it
may cause you to think of precious gums or spices
from the uttermost tropics; sometimes it is a thin,
thin sweetness,&mdash;like a ghost of musk. It is not
personal (though physical personality certainly
has an odor): it is the fragrance of a season,&mdash;of
the springtime of life. But even as the fragrance
of spring, though everywhere a passing delight,
varies with country and climate, so varies the
fragrance of youth.</p>

<p>Whether it be of one sex more than of another
were difficult to say. We notice it chiefly in girls
and in children with long hair, probably because
it dwells especially in the hair. But it is always
independent of artifice as the sweetness of the
wild violet is. It belongs to the youth of the
savage not less than to the youth of the civilized,&mdash;to
the adolescence of the peasant not less than
to that of the prince. It is not found in the sickly
and the feeble, but only in perfect joyous health.
Perhaps, like beauty, it may have some vague
general relation to conditions ethical. Individual
odors assuredly have,&mdash;as the discrimination of
the dog gives witness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>Evolutionists have suggested that the pleasure
we find in the perfume of a flower may be an emotional
reflection from æons enormously remote,
when such odor announced, to forms of ancestral
life far lower than human, the presence of savory
food. To what organic memory of association
might be due, upon the same hypothesis, our
pleasure in the perfume of youth?</p>

<p>Perhaps there were ages in which that perfume
had significances more definite and special than
any which we can now attach to it. Like the
pleasure yielded by the fragrance of flowers, the
pleasure given by the healthy fragrance of a
young body may be, partly at least, a survival
from some era in which odorous impressions
made direct appeal to the simplest of life-serving
impulses. Long dissociated from such possible
primitive relation, odor of blossom and odor of
youth alike have now become for us excitants of
the higher emotional life,&mdash;of vague but voluminous
and supremely delicate æsthetic feeling.</p>

<p>Like the feeling awakened by beauty, the pleasure
of odor is a pleasure of remembrance,&mdash;is
the magical appeal of a sensation to countless
memories of countless lives. And even as the
scent of a blossom evokes the ghosts of feelings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
experienced in millions of millions of unrecorded
springs,&mdash;so the fragrance of youth bestirs within
us the spectral survival of sensations associated
with every vernal cycle of all the human existence
that has vanished behind us.</p>

<p>And this fragrance of fresh being likewise
makes invocation to ideal sentiment,&mdash;to parental
scarcely less than to amorous tenderness,&mdash;because
conjoined through immeasurable time
with the charm and the beauty of childhood.
Out of night and death is summoned by its
necromancy more than a shadowy thrill from the
rapture of perished passion,&mdash;more than a phantom-reflex
from the delight of countless bridals;&mdash;even
something also of the ecstasy of pressing
lips of caress to the silky head of the first-born,&mdash;faint
refluence from the forgotten joy of myriad
millions of buried mothers.</p>

<h3>Azure Psychology</h3>

<div class="figcenter nobreak" style="width: 38px;">
<img src="images/zillt227.png" width="38" height="50" alt="decoration" />
</div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>Least common of the colors given by nature
to bird, insect, and blossom is bright
pure blue. Blue flowers are believed to
proclaim for the plant that bears them a longer
history of unchecked development than flowers of
any other primary color suggest; and the high
cost of the tint is perhaps hinted by the inability
of the horticulturist to produce blue roses or blue
chrysanthemums. Vivid blue appears in the
plumage of some wonderful birds, and on the
wings of certain amazing butterflies&mdash;especially
tropical butterflies;&mdash;but usually under conditions
that intimate a prodigious period of evolutional
specialization. Altogether it would seem
that blue was the latest pure color developed in
the evolution of flower and scale and feather; and
there is reason to believe that the power of perceiving
blue was not acquired until after the power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
of distinguishing red and green and yellow had
already been gained.</p>

<p>Whether the hypothesis be true or false, it is
certainly noteworthy that, of the primary colors,
blue alone has remained, up to the present time,
a color pleasurable in its purest intensity to the
vision of highly civilized races. Bright red, bright
green, bright orange, yellow, or violet, can be
used but sparingly in our nineteenth-century attire
and decoration. They have become offensive in
their spectral purity because of the violence of the
sensations that they give;&mdash;they remain grateful
only to the rudimentary æsthetic feeling of
children, of the totally uncultivated, or of savages.
What modern beauty clothes herself in scarlet,
or robes herself in fairy green? We cannot paint
our chambers violet or saffron&mdash;the mere idea
jars upon our nerves. But the color of heaven
has not ceased to delight us. Sky-blue can still
be worn by our fairest; and the luminous charm
of azure ceilings and azure wall-surfaces&mdash;under
certain conditions of lighting and dimension&mdash;is
still recognized.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless,” some one may say, “we do
not paint the <i>outside</i> of a building skyblue; and
a skyblue façade would be even more disagree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>able
than an orange or a crimson façade.” This
is true,&mdash;but not because the effect of the color
upon large surfaces is necessarily displeasing. It
is true only because vivid blue, unlike other
bright colors, is never associated in our experience
of nature with large and opaque <i>solidity</i>. When
mountains become blue for us, they also become
ghostly and semi-transparent. Upon a housefront
the color must appear monstrous, because giving
the notion of the unnatural,&mdash;of a huge blue
dead solidity tangibly proximate. But a blue
ceiling, a blue vault, blue walls of corridors, may
suggest the true relation of the color to depth and
transparency, and make for us a grateful illusion
of space and summer-light. Yellow, on the other
hand, is a color well adapted to façades, because
associated in memory with the beautiful effect of
dying sunlight over pale broad surfaces.</p>

<p>But although yellow remains, after blue, the
most agreeable of the primary colors, it cannot
often be used for artistic purposes, like blue, in
all its luminous strength. Pale tones of yellow,&mdash;especially
creamy tones,&mdash;are capable of an immense
variety of artistic employment; but this is
not true of the brilliant and burning yellow.
Only blue is always agreeable in its most vivid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
purity&mdash;providing that it be not used in massive
displays so as to suggest the anomaly of blue
hardness and blue opacity.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>In Japan, which may still be called the land of
perfect good taste in chromatics&mdash;notwithstanding
the temporary apparition of some discords
due to Western influence,&mdash;almost any ordinary
street-vista tells the story of the race-experience
with color. The general tone of the vista is
given by bluish greys above and dark blues below,
sharply relieved by numerous small details of
white and cool yellow. In this perspective the
bluish-greys represent the tiling of roofs and
awnings; the dark blues, shop-draperies; the
bright whites, narrow strips of plastered surface;
the pale yellows, mostly smooth naked
wood, and glimpses of rush-mattings. The
broader stretches of color are furthermore relieved
and softened by the sprinkling of countless ideographs
over draperies and shop-signs&mdash;black,
(and sometimes red) against white; white or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
gold on blue. Strong yellows, greens, oranges,
purples are invisible. In dress also greys and
cool blues rule: when you do happen to see
robes or <i>hakama</i> all of one brilliant color,&mdash;worn
by children or young girls,&mdash;that color is
either a sky-blue, or a violet with only just enough
red in it to kindle the azure,&mdash;a rainbow-violet
of exquisite luminosity.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>But I wish to speak neither of the æsthetic
value of blue in relation to arts and industries,
nor of the optical significance of blue as the product
of six hundred and fifty billion oscillations
of the luminous ether per second. I only want
to say something about the psychology of the
color,&mdash;about its subjective evolutional history.</p>

<p>Certainly the same apparition of blue will bestir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
in different minds different degrees of feeling, and
will set in motion, through memory-revival of
unlike experiences, totally dissimilar operations of
fancy. But independently of such psychological
variation&mdash;mainly personal and superficial,&mdash;there
can be no doubt that the color evokes in
the <i>general</i> mind one common quality of pleasurable
feeling,&mdash;a vivacious thrill,&mdash;a tone of
emotional activity unmistakably related to the
higher zones of sentiency and of imagination.</p>

<p class="tbpara">In my own case the sight of vivid blue has
always been accompanied by an emotion of vague
delight&mdash;more or less strong according to the
luminous intensity of the color. And in one
experience of travel,&mdash;sailing to the American
tropics,&mdash;this feeling rose into ecstasy. It was
when I beheld for the first time the grandest
vision of blue in this world,&mdash;the glory of the
Gulf-Stream: a magical splendor that made me
doubt my senses,&mdash;a flaming azure that looked
as if a million summer skies had been condensed
into pure fluid color for the making of it. The
captain of the ship leaned over the rail with me;
and we both watched the marvellous sea for a
long time in silence. Then he said:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p class="tbpara">“Fifteen years ago I took my wife with me on
this trip&mdash;just after we were married, it was;&mdash;and
she wondered at the water. She asked me to
get her a silk dress of the very same color. I
tried in ever so many places; but I never could
get just what she wanted till a chance took me
to Canton. I went round the Chinese silk-shops
day after day, looking for that color. It wasn’t
easy to find; but I did get it at last. Wasn’t
she glad, though, when I brought it home to her!...
She’s got it yet....”</p>

<p class="tbpara">Still, at times, in sleep, I sail southward again
over the wonder of that dazzling surging azure;&mdash;then
the dream shifts suddenly across the
world, and I am wandering with the Captain
through close dim queer Chinese streets,&mdash;vainly
seeking a silk of the Blue of the Gulf-Stream.
And it was this memory of tropic days that first
impelled me to think about the reason of the
delight inspired by the color.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>Possibly the wave of pleasurable emotion excited
by a glorious vision of blue is not more complex
than the feeling aroused by any massive
display of any other pure color;&mdash;but it is
higher in the quality of its complexity. For the
ideational elements that blend in the volume of it
include not a few of the noblest,&mdash;not a few of
those which also enter into the making of Cosmic
Emotion.</p>

<p>Being the seeming color of the ghost of our
planet,&mdash;of the breath of the life of the world,&mdash;blue
is likewise the color apparent of the enormity
of day and the abyss of the night. So the sensation
of it makes appeal to the ideas of Altitude,
of Vastness, and of Profundity;&mdash;</p>

<p>Also to the idea of Space in Time; for blue is
the tint of distance and of vagueness;&mdash;</p>

<p>Also to the idea of Motion; for blue is the
color of Vanishing and of Apparition. Peak and
vale, bay and promontory, turn blue as we leave
them; and out of blue they grow and define
again as we glide homeward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>And therefore in the volume of feeling awakened
in us by the sensation of blue, there should
be something of the emotion associated with experience
of change,&mdash;with countless ancestral
sorrows of parting. But if there indeed be any
such dim survival, it is utterly whelmed and lost
in that all-radiant emotional inheritance related
to Summer and Warmth,&mdash;to the joy of past
humanity in the light of cloudless days.</p>

<p>Still more significant is the fact that although
blue is a sacred color, the dominant tones of the
feeling it evokes are gladness and tenderness.
Blue speaks to us of the dead and of the gods,
but never of their awfulness.</p>

<p class="tbpara">Now when we reflect that blue is the color of
the idea of the divine, the color pantheistic, the
color ethical,&mdash;thrilling most deeply into those
structures of thought to which belong our sentiments
of reverence and justice, of duty and of
aspiration,&mdash;we may wonder why the emotion it
calls up should be supremely gladsome. Is it because
that sensuous race-experience of blue skies,&mdash;that
measureless joy of the dead in light and
warmth, which has been transmitted to each of us
in organic memory,&mdash;is vastly older than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
religious idea, and therefore voluminous enough
to drown any ethical feeling indirectly related to
the color-sensation? Partly so, no doubt;&mdash;but
I will venture another, and a very simple explanation:&mdash;</p>

<p class="tbpara"><i>All moral pulsations in the wave of inherited
feeling which responds to the impression of blue,
belong only to the beautiful and tender aspects
of faith.</i></p>

<p class="tbpara">And thus much having been ventured, I may
presume a little further.</p>

<p>I imagine that for many of us one of the most
powerful elements in this billow of pleasurable
feeling evoked by the vision of blue, <i>is</i> spiritual,
in the fullest ethical meaning of the word;&mdash;that
under the fleeting surface-plexus of personal emotion
empirically associated with the color, pulses
like a tide the transmitted religious emotion of
unnumbered ages;&mdash;and that, quickening and
vivifying all inherited sense of blue as beauty, is
the inherited lucent rapture of blue as the splendor
mystical,&mdash;as the color of the everlasting Peace.
Something of all human longing for all the Paradises
ever imagined,&mdash;of all pre-existent trust in
the promise of reunion after death,&mdash;of all ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>pired
dreams of unending youth and bliss,&mdash;may
be revived for us, more or less faintly, in this
thrill of the delight of azure. Even as through
the jewel-radiance of the Tropic Stream pass undulations
from the vaster deep,&mdash;with their sobbings
and whisperings, their fugitive drift and
foam,&mdash;so, through the emotion evoked by the
vision of luminous blue, there may somehow
quiver back to us out of the Infinite&mdash;(multitudinous
like the billion ether-shiverings that make
the blue sensation of a moment)&mdash;something of
all the aspirations of the ancient faiths, and the
power of the vanished gods, and the passion and
the beauty of all the prayer ever uttered by lips
of man.</p>

<h3>A Serenade</h3>

<div class="figcenter nobreak" style="width: 46px;">
<img src="images/zillchapterheading.png" width="46" height="50" alt="decoration" />
</div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>“Broken” were too abrupt a word. My
sleep was not broken, but suddenly
melted and swept away by a flow of
music from the night without,&mdash;music that filled
me with expectant ecstasy by the very first gush
of its sweetness: a serenade,&mdash;a playing of flutes
and mandolines.</p>

<p>The flutes had dove-tones; and they cooed
and moaned and purled;&mdash;and the mandolines
throbbed through the liquid plaint of them, like
a beating of hearts. The players I could not
see: they were standing in heavy shadows flung
into the street by a tropical moon,&mdash;shadows of
plantain and of tamarind.</p>

<p>Nothing in all the violet gloom moved but
that music, and the fire-flies,&mdash;great bright slow
sparks of orange and of emerald. The warm air
held its breath; the plumes of the palms were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
still; and the haunting circle of the sea, blue even
beneath the moon, lay soundless as a circle of
vapor.</p>

<p class="tbpara">Flutes and mandolines&mdash;a Spanish melody&mdash;nothing
more. Yet it seemed as if the night itself
were speaking, or, out of the night some passional
life long since melted into Nature’s mystery,
but continuing to haunt the tepid, odorous, sparkling
darkness of that strange world, which sleeps
under the sun, and wakens only to the stars.
And its utterance was the ghostly reiteration of
rapture that had been, and never again could be,&mdash;an
utterance of infinite tenderness and of immeasurable
regret.</p>

<p>Never before had I felt how the simplest of
music could express what no other art is able even
to suggest;&mdash;never before had I known the astonishing
possibilities of melody without ornament,
without artifice,&mdash;yet with a charm as
bewildering, as inapprehensible, as the Greek
perception of the grace supreme.</p>

<p>Now nothing in perfect art can be only voluptuous;
and this music, in despite of its caress,
was immeasurably, ineffably sad. And the exquisite
blending of melancholy with passion in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
motive so simple,&mdash;one low long cooing motive,
over and over again repeated, like a dove’s cry,&mdash;had
a <i>strangeness</i> of beauty like the musical
thought of a vanished time,&mdash;one rare survival,
out of an era more warmly human than our own,
of some lost art of melody.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>The music hushed, and left me dreaming, and
vainly trying to explain the emotion that it had
made. Of one thing only I felt assured,&mdash;that
the mystery was of other existences than mine.</p>

<p>For the living present, I reflected, is the whole
dead past. Our pleasures and our pains alike
are but products of evolution,&mdash;vast complexities
of sentiency created by experience of vanished
beings more countless than the sands of a myriad
seas. All personality is recombination; and all
emotions are of the dead. Yet some seem to us
more ghostly than others,&mdash;partly because of
their greater relative mystery, partly because of
the immense power of the phantom waves composing
them. Among pleasurable forms, the
ghostliest are the emotion of first love, the emo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>tion
following the perception of the sublime in
nature&mdash;of terrible beauty,&mdash;and the emotion
of music. Why should they so be? Probably
because the influences that arouse them thrill
furthest into our forgotten past. Frightful as the
depth of the abyss of Space is the depth of one
thinking life,&mdash;measureless even by millions of
ages;&mdash;and who may divine how profoundly in
certain personalities the mystery can be moved.
We only know that the deeper the thrilling, the
heavier the wave responding, and the weirder the
result,&mdash;until those profundities are reached of
which a single surge brings instant death, or
makes perpetual ruin of the delicate structures
of thought.</p>

<p>Now any music that makes powerful appeal
to the emotion of love, awakening the passional
latency of the past within us, must inevitably
revive dead pain not less than dead delight. Pain
of the conquest of will by a mystery resistless and
pitiless, the torture of doubt, the pangs of rivalry,
the terror of impermanency,&mdash;shadows of these
and many another sorrow have had their part in
the toning of that psychical inheritance which
makes at once love’s joy and love’s anguish, and
grows forever from birth to birth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>And thus it may happen that a child, innocent
of passion or of real pain, is moved even to tears
by music uttering either. Unknowingly he feels
in that utterance a shadowing of the sorrow of
numberless vanished lives.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>But it seemed to me that the extraordinary
emotion awakened by that tropical melody needed
an explanation more qualitative than the explanation
above attempted. I felt sure that the dead
past to which the music had made appeal must
have been a special past,&mdash;that some particular
class or group of emotional memories had been
touched. Yet what class?&mdash;what group? For
the time being, I could not even venture a guess.</p>

<p>Long afterwards, however, some chance happening
revived for me with surprising distinctness
the memory of the serenade;&mdash;and simultaneously,
like a revelation, came the certainty that
the whole spell of the melody&mdash;all its sadness
and all its sweetness&mdash;had been supremely and
uniquely <i>feminine</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>&mdash;“Assuredly,” I reflected, as the new conviction
grew upon me, “the primal source of all
human tenderness has been the Eternal Feminine....
Yet how should melody uttering only the
soul of woman have been composed by man,
and bestir within man this innominable quickening
of emotional reminiscence?”</p>

<p>The answer shaped itself at once,&mdash;</p>

<p>&mdash;“<i>Every mortal man has been many millions
of times a woman.</i>”</p>

<p class="tbpara">Undoubtedly in either sex survives the sum of
the feelings and of the memories of both. But
some rare experience may appeal at times to the
feminine element of personality alone,&mdash;to one
half only of the phantom-world of Self,&mdash;leaving
the other hemisphere dormant and unillumed.
And such experience had found embodiment in
the marvellous melody of the serenade which I
had heard.</p>

<p>That tremulous sweetness was never masculine;
that passional sadness never was of man:&mdash;unisexual
both and inseparably blended into a single
miracle of tone-beauty. Echoing far into the
mystery of my own past, the enchantment of that
tone had startled from their sleep of ages count<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>less
buried loves, and set the whole delicate swarm
fluttering in some delicious filmy agony of revival,&mdash;set
them streaming and palpitating through the
Night of Time,&mdash;like those myriads eddying
forever through the gloom of the vision of Dante.</p>

<p class="tbpara">They died with the music and the moon,&mdash;but
not utterly. Whenever in dream the memory of
that melody returns, again I feel the long soft
shuddering of the dead,&mdash;again I feel the faint
wings spread and thrill, responsive to the cooing
of those spectral flutes, to the throbbing of those
shadowy mandolines. And the elfish ecstasy of
their thronging awakes me; but always with
my wakening the delight passes, and in the
dark the sadness only lingers,&mdash;unutterable,&mdash;infinite...!</p>

<h3>A Red Sunset</h3>

<div class="figcenter nobreak" style="width: 46px;">
<img src="images/zillchapterheading.png" width="46" height="50" alt="decoration" />
</div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>The most stupendous apparition of red that I
ever saw was a tropical sunset in a cloudless
sky,&mdash;a sunset such as can be witnessed
only during exceptional conditions of
atmosphere. It began with a flaming of orange
from horizon to zenith; and this quickly deepened
to a fervid vermilion, through which the crimson
disk glared like the cinder of a burnt-out star.
Sea, peak, and palm caught the infernal glow;
and I became conscious of a vague strange horror
within myself,&mdash;a sense of distress like that
which precedes a nightmare. I could not then
explain the feeling;&mdash;I only knew that the color
had aroused it.</p>

<p>But how aroused it?&mdash;I later asked myself.
Common theories about the ugly sensation of
bright red could not explain for me the weirdness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
of that experience. As for the sanguine associations
of the color, they could interpret little in
my case; for the sight of blood had never affected
my nerves in the least. I thought that the theory
of psychical inheritance might furnish some explanation;&mdash;but
how could it meet the fact that a
color, which the adult finds insufferable, continues
to delight the child?</p>

<p>All ruddy tones, however, are not unpleasant
to refined sensibility: some are quite the reverse,&mdash;as,
for example, the various tender colors called
pink or rose. These appeal to very agreeable
kinds of sensuous experience: they suggest delicacy
and softness; they awaken qualities of
feeling totally different from those excited by
vermilion or scarlet. Pink, being the tint of the
blossoming of flowers and the blossoming of
youth,&mdash;of the ripeness of fruit and the ripeness
of flesh, is ever associated with impressions
of fragrance and sweetness, and with memories
of beautiful lips and cheeks.</p>

<p>No: it is only the pure brilliant red, the fervid
red, that arouses sinister feeling. Experience with
this color seems to have been the same even in
societies evolved under conditions utterly unlike
those of our own history,&mdash;Japan being a signifi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>cant
example. The more refined and humane a
civilization becomes, the less are displays of the
color tolerated in its cultivated circles. But how
are we to account for that pleasure which bright
red still gives to the children of the people who
detest it?</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>Many sensations which delighted us as children,
prove to us either insipid or offensive in adult life.
Why? Because there have grown up with our
growth feelings which, though now related to
them, were dormant during childhood; ideas
now associated with them, but undeveloped during
childhood; and experiences connected with
them, never imagined in childhood.</p>

<p>For the mind, at our birth, is even less developed
than the body; and its full ripening demands
very much more time than is needed for the perfect
bodily growth. Both by his faults and by
his virtues the child resembles the savage, because
the instincts and the emotions of the primitive man
are the first to mature within him;&mdash;and they
are the first to mature in the individual because
they were the first evolved in the history of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
race, being the most necessary to self-maintenance.
That in later adult life they take a very inferior
place is because the nobler mental and moral
qualities&mdash;comparatively recent products of social
discipline and civilized habit&mdash;have at last gained
massiveness enough to dominate them under
normal conditions;&mdash;have become like powerful
new senses upon which the primitive emotional
nature learns to depend for guidance.</p>

<p>All emotions are inheritances; but the higher,
because in evolutional order the latest, develop
only with the complete unfolding of the brain.
Some, ethically considered the very loftiest, are
said to develop only in old age,&mdash;to which they
impart a particular charm. Other faculties also
of a high order, chiefly æsthetic, would seem in
the average of cases to mature in middle life.
And to this period of personal evolution probably
belongs the finer sense of beauty in color,&mdash;a
much simpler faculty than the ethical sense,
though possibly related to it in ways unsuspected.</p>

<p>Vivid colors appeal to the rudimentary æsthetic
sense of our children, as they do to the æsthetic
sense of savages; but the civilized adult dislikes
most of the very vivid colors: they exasperate
his nerves like an excessive crash of brass and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
drums during a cheap orchestral performance.
Cultured vision especially shrinks from a strong
blaze of red. Only the child delights in vermilion
and scarlet. Growing up he gradually learns
to think of what we call “loud red” as vulgar,
and to dislike it much more than did his less delicate
ancestors of the preceding century. Education
helps him to explain why he thinks it vulgar,
but not to explain why he <i>feels</i> it to be unpleasant,&mdash;independently
of the question whether it
tires his eyes.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>And now I come back to the subject of that
tropical sunset.</p>

<p>Even in the common æsthetic emotion excited
by the spectacle of any fine sunset, there are elements
of feeling ancient as the race,&mdash;dim melancholy,
dim fear, inherited from ages when the
dying of the day was ever watched with sadness
and foreboding. After that mighty glow, the
hours of primeval horror,&mdash;the fear of blackness,
the fear of nocturnal foes, the fear of
ghosts. These, and other weird feelings,&mdash;independently
of the physical depression following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
the withdrawal of sunlight,&mdash;would by inheritance
become emotionally related to visions of
sundown; and the primitive horror would at last
be evolutionally transmuted to one elemental tone
of the modern sublime. But the spectacle of a
vast <i>crimson</i> sunset would awaken feelings less
vague than the sense of the sublime,&mdash;feelings
of a definitely sinister kind. The very
color itself would make appeal to special kinds
of inherited feelings, simply because of its relation
to awful spectacles,&mdash;the glare of the volcano-summit,
the furious vermilion of lava, the
raging of forest-fires, the overglow of cities kindling
in the track of war, the smouldering of ruin,
the blazing of funeral-pyres. And in this lurid
race-memory of fire as destroyer,&mdash;as the “ravening
ghost” of Northern fancy,&mdash;there would
mingle a vague distress evolved through ancestral
experience of <i>crimson heat in relation to
pain</i>,&mdash;an organic horror. And the like tremendous
color in celestial phenomena would revive
also inherited terror related of old to ideas
of the portentous and of the wrath of gods.</p>

<p class="tbpara">Probably the largest element of the unpleasant
feeling aroused in man by this angry color has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
been made by the experience of the race with
fire. But in even the most vivid red there is
always some suggestion of passion, and of the
tint of blood. Inherited emotion related to the
sight of death must be counted among the elements
of the sinister feeling that the hue excites.
Doubtless for the man, as for the bull, the emotional
wave called up by displays of violent red,
is mostly the creation of impressions and of tendencies
accumulated through all the immense life
of the race; and, as in the old story of Thomas
the Rhymer, we can say of our only real Fairy-land,
our ghostly past,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">... “<i>A’ the blude that’s shed on earth</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Rins through the springs o’ that Countrie.</i>”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But those very associations that make burning
red unbearable to modern nerves must have
already been enormously old when it first became
the color of pomp and luxury. How then should
such associations affect us unpleasantly now?</p>

<p>I would answer that the emotional suggestions
of the color continued to be pleasurable for the
adult, as they still are for the child, only while
they remained more vague and much less voluminous
than at present. Becoming intensified in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
the modern brain, they gradually ceased to yield
pleasure,&mdash;somewhat as warmth increased to the
degree of heat ceases to be pleasurable. Still later
they became painful; and their actual painfulness
exposes the fundamentally savage nature of those
sensations of splendor and power which the color
once called into play. And the intensification
of the feeling evoked by red has not been due
merely to later accumulation of inherited impressions,
but also to the growth and development of
emotions essentially antithetical to ideas of violence
and pain, and yet inseparable from them. The
moral sensibility of an era that has condemned
not a few of the amusements of our forebears to
the limbo of old barbarities,&mdash;the humanity of
an age that refuses to believe in a hell of literal
fire, that prohibits every brutal sport, that compels
kindness to animals,&mdash;is offended by the
cruel suggestiveness of the color. But within the
slowly-unfolding brain of the child, this modern
sensibility is not evolved;&mdash;and until it has been
evolved, with the aid of experience and of education,
the feeling aroused by such a color as vivid
scarlet will naturally continue to be pleasurable
rather than painful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>While thus trying to explain why a color dignified
as imperial in other centuries should have
become offensive in our own, I found myself
wondering whether most of our actual refinements
might not in like manner become the vulgarities
of a future age. Our standards of taste and our
ideals of beauty can have only a value relative to
conditions which are constantly changing. Real
and ideal alike are transitory,&mdash;mere apparitional
undulations in the flux of the perpetual Becoming.
Perhaps the finest ethical or æsthetical sentiment
of to-day will manifest itself in another era only
as some extraordinary psychological atavism,&mdash;some
rare individual reversion to the conditions
of a barbarous past.</p>

<p>What in the meantime would be the fate of
sensations that are even now becoming intolerable?
Any faculty, mental or physical, however
previously developed by evolutional necessities,
would have a tendency to dwindle and disappear
from the moment that it ceased to be either useful
or pleasurable. Continuance of the power to
perceive red would depend upon the possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
future usefulness of that power to the race. Not
without suggestiveness in this connection may be
the fact that it represents the lowest rate of those
ether-oscillations which produce color. Perhaps
our increasing dislike to it indicates that power to
distinguish it will eventually pass away&mdash;pass
away in a sort of Daltonism at the inferior end
of the color-scale. Such visual loss would probably
be more than compensated by superior coincident
specializations of retinal sensibility. A
more highly organized generation might enjoy
wonders of color now unimaginable, and yet
never be able to perceive red,&mdash;not, at least, that
red whose sensation is the spectral smouldering
of the agonies and the furies of our evolutional
past, the haunting of a horror innominable,
immeasurable,&mdash;enormous phantom-menace of
expired human pain.</p>

<h3>Frisson</h3>

<div class="figcenter nobreak" style="width: 46px;">
<img src="images/zillchapterheading.png" width="46" height="50" alt="decoration" />
</div>


<p>Some there may be who have never felt the
thrill of a human touch; but surely these
are few! Most of us in early childhood
discover strange differences in physical contact;&mdash;we
find that some caresses soothe, while others
irritate; and we form in consequence various unreasoning
likes and antipathies. With the ripening
of youth we seem to feel these distinctions
more and more keenly,&mdash;until the fateful day
in which we learn that a certain feminine touch
communicates an unspeakable shiver of delight,&mdash;exercises
a witchcraft that we try to
account for by theories of the occult and the
supernatural. Age may smile at these magical
fancies of youth; and nevertheless, in spite of
much science, the imagination of the lover is
probably nearer to truth than is the wisdom of
the disillusioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>We seldom permit ourselves in mature life to
think very seriously about such experiences. We
do not deny them; but we incline to regard them
as nervous idiosyncrasies. We scarcely notice
that even in the daily act of shaking hands with
persons of either sex, sensations may be received
which no physiology can explain.</p>

<p>I remember the touch of many hands,&mdash;the
quality of each clasp, the sense of physical sympathy
or repulsion aroused. Thousands I have
indeed forgotten,&mdash;probably because their contact
told me nothing in particular; but the strong
experiences I fully recollect. I found that their
agreeable or disagreeable character was often quite
independent of the moral relation: but in the
most extraordinary case that I can recall&mdash;(a
strangely fascinating personality with the strangest
of careers as poet, soldier, and refugee)&mdash;the
moral and the physical charm were equally
powerful and equally rare. “Whenever I shake
hands with that man,” said to me one of many
who had yielded to his spell, “I feel a warm
shock go all through me, like a glow of summer.”
Even at this moment when I think of
that dead hand, I can feel it reached out to me
over the space of twenty years and of many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
a thousand miles. Yet it was a hand that had
killed....</p>

<p class="tbpara">These, with other memories and reflections,
came to me just after reading a criticism on Mr.
Bain’s evolutional interpretation of the thrill of
pleasure sometimes given by the touch of the
human skin. The critic asked why a satin
cushion kept at a temperature of about 98°
would not give the same thrill; and the question
seemed to me unfair because, in the very passage
criticised, Mr. Bain had sufficiently suggested the
reason. Taking him to have meant&mdash;as he must
have meant,&mdash;not that the thrill is given by any
kind of warmth and softness, but only by the
<i>peculiar</i> warmth and softness of the human skin,
his interpretation can scarcely be contested by a
sarcasm. A satin cushion at a temperature of
about 98° could not give the same sensation as
that given by the touch of the human skin for
reasons even much more simple than Mr. Bain
implied,&mdash;since it is totally different from the
human skin in substance, in texture, and in the
all-important fact that it is not alive, but dead.
Of course warmth and softness in themselves are
not enough to produce the thrill of pleasure con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>sidered
by Mr. Bain: under easily imaginable circumstances
they may produce something of the
reverse. Smoothness has quite as much to do
with the pleasure of touch as either softness or
warmth can have; yet a moist or a very dry
smoothness may be disagreeable. Again, cool
smoothness in the human skin is perhaps even
more agreeable than warm smoothness; yet there
is a cool smoothness common to many lower
forms of life which causes a shudder. Whatever be
those qualities making pleasurable the touch of a
hand, for example, they are probably very many
in combination, and they are certainly peculiar to
the <i>living</i> touch. No possible artificial combination
of warmth and smoothness and softness
combined could excite the same quality of pleasure
that certain human touches give,&mdash;although, as
other psychologists than Mr. Bain have observed,
it may give rise to a fainter kind of agreeable
feeling.</p>

<p>A special sensation can be explained only by
special conditions. Some philosophers would explain
the conditions producing this pleasurable
thrill, or <i>frisson</i>, as mainly subjective; others, as
mainly objective. Is it not most likely that either
view contains truth;&mdash;that the physical cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
must be sought in some quality, definable or indefinable,
attaching to a particular touch; and that
the cause of the coincident emotional phenomena
should be looked for in the experience, not of the
individual, but of the race?</p>

<p class="tbpara">Remembering that there can be no two tangible
things exactly alike,&mdash;no two blades of
grass, or drops of water, or grains of sand,&mdash;it
ought not to seem incredible that the touch of
one person should have power to impart a sensation
different from any sensation producible by
the touch of any other person. That such difference
could neither be estimated nor qualified
would not necessarily imply unimportance or
even feebleness. Among the voices of the thousands
of millions of human beings in this world,
there are no two precisely the same;&mdash;yet how
much to the ear and to the heart of wife or mother,
child or lover, may signify the unspeakably fine
difference by which each of a billion voices varies
from every other! Not even in thought, much
less in words, can such distinction be specified;
but who is unfamiliar with the fact and with its
immense relative importance?</p>

<p>That any two human skins should be abso<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>lutely
alike is not possible. There are individual
variations perceptible even to the naked eye,&mdash;for
has not Mr. Galton taught us that the visible
finger-marks of no two persons are the same?
But in addition to differences visible&mdash;whether
to the naked eye, or only under the microscope,
there must be other differences of quality depending
upon constitutional vigor, upon nervous
and glandular activities, upon relative
chemical composition of tissue. Whether touch
be a sense delicate enough to discern such differences,
would be, of course, a question for
psycho-physics to decide,&mdash;and a question not
simply of magnitudes, but of qualities of sensation.
Perhaps it is not yet even legitimate to
suppose that, just as by ear we can distinguish
the qualitative differences of a million voices, so
by touch we might be able to distinguish qualitative
differences of surface scarcely less delicate.
Yet it is worth while here to remark that the
tingle or shiver of pleasure excited in us by certain
qualities of voice, very much resembles the
thrill given sometimes by the touch of a hand.
Is it not possible that there may be recognized, in
the particular quality of a living skin, something
not less uniquely attractive than the indeter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>minable
charm of what we call a bewitching
voice?</p>

<p>Perhaps it is not impossible. But in the character
of the <i>frisson</i> itself there is a hint that the
charm of the touch provoking it may be due to
something much more deeply vital than any
physical combination of smoothness, warmth
and softness,&mdash;to something, as Mr. Bain has
suggested, electric or magnetic. Human electricity
is no fiction: every living body,&mdash;even a
plant,&mdash;is to some degree electrical; and the
electric conditions of no two organisms would
be exactly the same. Can the thrill be partly
accounted for by some individual peculiarity of
these conditions? May there not be electrical
differences of touch appreciable by delicate nervous
systems,&mdash;differences subtle as those infinitesimal
variations of timbre by which every
voice of a million voices is known from every
other?</p>

<p>Such a theory might be offered in explanation
of the fact that the slightest touch of a particular
woman, for example, will cause a shock of pleasure
to men whom the caresses of other and fairer
women would leave indifferent. But it could not
serve to explain why the same contact should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
produce no effect upon some persons, while causing
ecstasy in others. No purely physical theory
can interpret all the mystery of the <i>frisson</i>. A
deeper explanation is needed;&mdash;and I imagine
that one is suggested by the phenomenon of
“love <i>at first sight</i>.”</p>

<p>The power of a woman to inspire love at first
sight does not depend upon some attraction
visible to the common eye. It depends partly
upon something objective which only certain
eyes can see; and it depends partly upon some
thing which no mortal can see,&mdash;<i>the psychical
composition of the subject of the passion</i>. Nobody
can pretend to explain in detail the whole
enigma of first love. But a general explanation
is suggested by evolutional philosophy,&mdash;namely,
that the attraction depends upon an inherited individual
susceptibility to special qualities of feminine
influence, and subjectively represents a kind
of superindividual recognition,&mdash;a sudden wakening
of that inherited composite memory which
is more commonly called “passional affinity.”
Certainly if first love be evolutionally explicable,
it means the perception by the lover of some
thing differentiating the beloved from all other
women,&mdash;something corresponding to an in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>herited
ideal within himself, previously latent,
but suddenly lighted and defined by result of
that visual impression.</p>

<p>And like sight, though perhaps less deeply, do
other of our senses reach into the buried past. A
single strain of melody, the sweetness of a single
voice&mdash;what thrill immeasurable will either
make in the fathomless sleep of ancestral memory!
Again, who does not know that speechless
delight bestirred in us on rare bright days by
something odorous in the atmosphere,&mdash;enchanting,
but indefinable? The first breath of
spring, the blowing of a mountain breeze, a
south wind from the sea may bring this emotion,&mdash;emotion
overwhelming, yet nameless as its
cause,&mdash;an ecstasy formless and transparent as
the air. Whatever be the odor, diluted to very
ghostliness, that arouses this delight, the delight
itself is too weirdly voluminous to be explained
by any memory-revival of merely individual experience.
More probably it is older even than
human life,&mdash;reaches deeper into the infinite
blind depth of dead pleasure and pain.</p>

<p>Out of that ghostly abyss also must come the
thrill responding within us to a living touch,&mdash;touch
electrical of man, questioning the heart,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>touch
magical of woman, invoking memory of
caresses given by countless delicate and loving
hands long crumbled into dust. Doubt it not!&mdash;the
touch that makes a thrill within you is a
touch that you have felt before,&mdash;sense-echo of
forgotten intimacies in many unremembered
lives!</p>

<h4>I</h4>

<p>I doubt if there be any other form of terror
that even approaches the fear of the supernatural,
and more especially the fear of
the supernatural in dreams. Children know this
fear both by night and by day; but the adult
is not likely to suffer from it except in slumber,
or under the most abnormal conditions of mind
produced by illness. Reason, in our healthy waking
hours, keeps the play of ideas far above those
deep-lying regions of inherited emotion where
dwell the primitive forms of terror. But even as
known to the adult in dreams only, there is no
waking fear comparable to this fear,&mdash;none so
deep and yet so vague,&mdash;none so unutterable.
The indefiniteness of the horror renders verbal
expression of it impossible; yet the suffering is
so intense that, if prolonged beyond a certain
term of seconds, it will kill. And the reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
is that such fear is not of the individual life: it
is infinitely more massive than any personal
experience could account for;&mdash;it is prenatal,
ancestral fear. Dim it necessarily is, because
compounded of countless blurred millions of inherited
fears. But for the same reason, its depth
is abysmal.</p>

<p>The training of the mind under civilization has
been directed toward the conquest of fear in general,
and&mdash;excepting that ethical quality of the
feeling which belongs to religion&mdash;of the supernatural
in particular. Potentially in most of us
this fear exists; but its sources are well-guarded;
and outside of sleep it can scarcely perturb any
vigorous mind except in the presence of facts so
foreign to all relative experience that the imagination
is clutched before the reason can grapple
with the surprise.</p>

<p>Once only, after the period of childhood, I
knew this emotion in a strong form. It was remarkable
as representing the vivid projection of a
dream-fear into waking consciousness; and the
experience was peculiarly tropical. In tropical
countries, owing to atmospheric conditions, the
oppression of dreams is a more serious suffering
than with us, and is perhaps most common dur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>ing
the siesta. All who can afford it pass their
nights in the country; but for obvious reasons
the majority of colonists must be content to take
their siesta, and its consequences, in town.</p>

<p>The West-Indian siesta does not refresh like
that dreamless midday nap which we enjoy in
Northern summers. It is a stupefaction rather
than a sleep,&mdash;beginning with a miserable feeling
of weight at the base of the brain: it is a helpless
surrender of the whole mental and physical being
to the overpressure of light and heat. Often it
is haunted by ugly visions, and often broken by
violent leaps of the heart. Occasionally it is
disturbed also by noises never noticed at other
times. When the city lies all naked to the sun,
stripped by noon of every shadow, and empty of
wayfarers, the silence becomes amazing. In that
silence the papery rustle of a palm-leaf, or the
sudden sound of a lazy wavelet on the beach,&mdash;like
the clack of a thirsty tongue,&mdash;comes immensely
magnified to the ear. And this noon,
with its monstrous silence, is for the black people
the hour of ghosts. Everything alive is senseless
with the intoxication of light;&mdash;even the woods
drowse and droop in their wrapping of lianas,
drunk with sun....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>Out of the siesta I used to be most often startled,
not by sounds, but by something which I can
describe only as a sudden shock of thought.
This would follow upon a peculiar internal commotion
caused, I believe, by some abnormal effect
of heat upon the lungs. A slow suffocating sensation
would struggle up into the twilight-region between
half-consciousness and real sleep, and there
bestir the ghastliest imaginings,&mdash;fancies and
fears of living burial. These would be accompanied
by a voice, or rather the idea of a voice,
mocking and reproaching:&mdash;“‘<i>Truly the light
is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes
to behold the sun.</i>’... Outside it is day,&mdash;tropical
day,&mdash;primeval day! And you sleep!!...
‘<i>Though a man live many years and rejoice
in them all, yet&mdash;</i>’ ... Sleep on!&mdash;all this
splendor will be the same when your eyes are
dust!... ‘<i>Yet let him remember the days of
darkness</i>;&mdash;<span class="smcap">for they shall be MANY</span>!’”</p>

<p class="tbpara">How often, with that phantom crescendo in my
ears, have I leaped in terror from the hot couch,
to peer through the slatted shutters at the enormous
light without&mdash;silencing, mesmerizing;&mdash;then
dashed cold water over my head, and stag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>gered
back to the scorching mattress, again to
drowse, again to be awakened by the same voice,
or by the trickling of my own perspiration&mdash;a
feeling not always to be distinguished from that
caused by the running of a centipede! And how
I used to long for the night, with its Cross of the
South! Not because the night ever brought coolness
to the city, but because it brought relief from
the <i>weight</i> of that merciless sunfire. For the
feeling of such light is the feeling of a deluge of
something ponderable,&mdash;something that drowns
and dazzles and burns and numbs all at the same
time, and suggests the idea of liquified electricity.</p>

<p class="tbpara">There are times, however, when the tropical
heat seems only to thicken after sunset. On the
mountains the nights are, as a rule, delightful the
whole year round. They are even more delightful
on the coast facing the trade-winds; and you
may sleep there in a seaward chamber, caressed
by a warm, strong breeze,&mdash;a breeze that plays
upon you not by gusts or whiffs, but with a
steady ceaseless blowing,&mdash;the great fanning
wind-current of the world’s whirling. But in the
towns of the other coast&mdash;nearly all situated at
the base of wooded ranges cutting off the trade-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>breeze,&mdash;the
humid atmosphere occasionally becomes
at night something nameless,&mdash;something
worse than the air of an overheated conservatory.
Sleep in such a medium is apt to be visited by
nightmare of the most atrocious kind.</p>

<p>My personal experience was as follows:&mdash;</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>I was making a tour of the island with a half-breed
guide; and we had to stop for one night in
a small leeward-coast settlement, where we found
accommodation at a sort of lodging-house kept
by an aged widow. There were seven persons
only in the house that night,&mdash;the old lady, her
two daughters, two colored female-servants, myself
and my guide. We were given a single-windowed
room upstairs, rather small,&mdash;otherwise
a typical, Creole bedroom, with bare clean floor,
some heavy furniture of antique pattern, and a
few rocking-chairs. There was in one corner a
bracket supporting a sort of household shrine&mdash;what
the Creoles call a <i>chapelle</i>. The shrine
contained a white image of the Virgin before
which a tiny light was floating in a cup of oil.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
By colonial custom your servant, while travelling
with you, sleeps either in the same room, or
before the threshold; and my man simply lay
down on a mat beside the huge four-pillared
couch assigned to me, and almost immediately
began to snore. Before getting into bed, I satisfied
myself that the door was securely fastened.</p>

<p class="tbpara">The night stifled;&mdash;the air seemed to be coagulating.
The single large window, overlooking a
garden, had been left open,&mdash;but there was no
movement in that atmosphere. Bats&mdash;very large
bats,&mdash;flew soundlessly in and out;&mdash;one actually
fanning my face with its wings as it circled
over the bed. Heavy scents of ripe fruit&mdash;nauseously
sweet&mdash;rose from the garden, where
palms and plantains stood still as if made of
metal. From the woods above the town stormed
the usual night-chorus of tree-frogs, insects, and
nocturnal birds,&mdash;a tumult not to be accurately
described by any simile, but suggesting, through
numberless sharp tinkling tones, the fancy of a
wide slow cataract of broken glass. I tossed and
turned on the hot hard bed, vainly trying to find
one spot a little cooler than the rest. Then I rose,
drew a rocking-chair to the window and lighted a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
cigar. The smoke hung motionless; after each
puff, I had to blow it away. My man had ceased
to snore. The bronze of his naked breast&mdash;shining
with moisture under the faint light of the
shrine-lamp,&mdash;showed no movement of respiration.
He might have been a corpse. The heavy
heat seemed always to become heavier. At last,
utterly exhausted, I went back to bed, and slept.</p>

<p class="tbpara">It must have been well after midnight when I
felt the first vague uneasiness,&mdash;<i>the suspicion</i>,&mdash;that
precedes a nightmare. I was half-conscious,
dream-conscious of the actual,&mdash;knew myself in
that very room,&mdash;wanted to get up. Immediately
the uneasiness grew into terror, because I
found that I could not move. Something unutterable
in the air was mastering will. I tried to
cry out, and my utmost effort resulted only in a
whisper too low for any one to hear. Simultaneously
I became aware of a Step ascending the
stair,&mdash;a muffled heaviness; and the real nightmare
began,&mdash;the horror of the ghastly magnetism
that held voice and limb,&mdash;the hopeless
will-struggle against dumbness and impotence.
The stealthy Step approached, but with lentor
malevolently measured,&mdash;slowly, slowly, as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
the stairs were miles deep. It gained the threshold,&mdash;waited.
Gradually then, and without
sound, the locked door opened; and the Thing
entered, bending as it came,&mdash;a thing robed,&mdash;feminine,&mdash;reaching
to the roof,&mdash;not to be
looked at! A floor-plank creaked as It neared
the bed;&mdash;and then&mdash;with a frantic effort&mdash;I
woke, bathed in sweat; my heart beating as if it
were going to burst. The shrine-light had died:
in the blackness I could see nothing; but I thought
I heard that Step retreating. I certainly heard
the plank creak again. With the panic still upon
me, I was actually unable to stir. The wisdom
of striking a match occurred to me, but I dared
not yet rise. Presently, as I held my breath to
listen, a new wave of black fear passed through
me; for I heard moanings,&mdash;long nightmare
moanings,&mdash;moanings that seemed to be answering
each other from two different rooms below.
And then, close to me, my guide began to moan,&mdash;hoarsely,
hideously. I cried to him:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Louis!&mdash;Louis!”</p>

<p>We both sat up at once. I heard him panting,
and I knew that he was fumbling for his cutlass
in the dark. Then, in a voice husky with fear, he
asked:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i>Missié, ess ou tanne?</i>” [<span lang="fr">Monsieur, est-ce que
vous entendez?</span>]</p>

<p>The moaners continued to moan,&mdash;always in
crescendo: then there were sudden screams,&mdash;“<i lang="fr">Madame!</i>”&mdash;“<i lang="fr">Manzell!</i>”&mdash;and
running of
bare feet, and sounds of lamps being lighted, and,
at last, a general clamor of frightened voices. I
rose, and groped for the matches. The moans
and the clamor ceased.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Missié</i>,” my man asked again, “<i lang="fr">ess ou tè
oué y?</i>” [<span lang="fr">Monsieur, est-ce que vous l’avez vue?</span>]</p>

<p>&mdash;“<i lang="fr">Ça ou le di?</i>” [<span lang="fr">Qu’est-ce que vous voulez
dire?</span>] I responded in bewilderment, as my fingers
closed on the match-box.</p>

<p>&mdash;“<i lang="fr">Fenm-là?</i>” he answered.... <strong>That
Woman?</strong></p>

<p>The question shocked me into absolute immobility.
Then I wondered if I could have understood.
But he went on in his patois, as if talking
to himself:&mdash;</p>

<p>&mdash;“Tall, tall&mdash;high like this room, that Zombi.
When She came the floor cracked. I heard&mdash;I
saw.”</p>

<p>After a moment, I succeeded in lighting a candle,
and I went to the door. It was still locked,&mdash;double-locked.
No human being could have
entered through the high window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>&mdash;“Louis!” I said, without believing what I
said,&mdash;“you have been only dreaming.”</p>

<p>&mdash;“Missié,” he answered, “it was no dream.
<i>She has been in all the rooms, touching people!</i>”</p>

<p>I said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&mdash;“That is foolishness! See!&mdash;the door is
double-locked.”</p>

<p>Louis did not even look at the door, but
responded:&mdash;</p>

<p>&mdash;“Door locked, door not locked, Zombi
comes and goes.... I do not like this house....
Missié, leave that candle burning!”</p>

<p>He uttered the last phrase imperatively, without
using the respectful <i>souplé</i>&mdash;just as a guide
speaks at an instant of common danger; and his
tone conveyed to me the contagion of his fear.
Despite the candle, I knew for one moment the
sensation of nightmare outside of sleep! The
coincidences stunned reason; and the hideous
primitive fancy fitted itself, like a certitude, to the
explanation of cause and effect. The similarity
of my vision and the vision of Louis, the creaking
of the floor heard by us both, the visit of the
nightmare to every room in succession,&mdash;these
formed a more than unpleasant combination of
evidence. I tried the planking with my foot in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
the place where I thought I had seen the figure:
it uttered the very same loud creak that I had
heard before. “<i>Ça pa ka sam révé</i>,” said Louis.
No!&mdash;that was not like dreaming. I left the
candle burning, and went back to bed&mdash;not to
sleep, but to think. Louis lay down again, with
his hand on the hilt of his cutlass.</p>

<p class="tbpara">I thought for a long time. All was now silent
below. The heat was at last lifting; and occasional
whiffs of cooler air from the garden announced
the wakening of a land-breeze. Louis,
in spite of his recent terror, soon began to snore
again. Then I was startled by hearing a plank
creak&mdash;quite loudly,&mdash;the same plank that I had
tried with my foot. This time Louis did not
seem to hear it. There was nothing there. It
creaked twice more,&mdash;and I understood. The
intense heat first, and the change of temperature
later, had been successively warping and unwarping
the wood so as to produce those sounds. In
the state of dreaming, which is the state of imperfect
sleep, noises may be audible enough to
affect imagination strongly,&mdash;and may startle
into motion a long procession of distorted fancies.
At the same time it occurred to me that the al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>most
concomitant experiences of nightmare in
the different rooms could be quite sufficiently explained
by the sickening atmospheric oppression
of the hour.</p>

<p>There still remained the ugly similitude of
the two dreams to be accounted for; and a
natural solution of this riddle also, I was able to
find after some little reflection. The coincidence
had certainly been startling; but the similitude
was only partial. That which my guide had
seen in his nightmare was a familiar creation of
West-Indian superstition&mdash;probably of African
origin. But the shape that I had dreamed about
used to vex my sleep in childhood,&mdash;a phantom
created for me by the impression of a certain
horrible Celtic story which ought not to have
been told to any child blessed, or cursed, with an
imagination.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>Musing on this experience led me afterwards
to think about the meaning of that fear which
we call “the fear of darkness,” and yet is not
really fear of darkness. Darkness, as a simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
condition, never could have originated the feeling,&mdash;a
feeling that must have preceded any
definite idea of ghosts by thousands of ages.
The inherited, instinctive fear, as exhibited by
children, is not a fear of darkness in itself, but
of indefinable danger associated with darkness.
Evolutionally explained, this dim but voluminous
terror would have for its primal element the impressions
created by real experience&mdash;experience
of something acting in darkness;&mdash;and the fear
of the supernatural would mingle in it only as a
much later emotional development. The primeval
cavern-gloom lighted by nocturnal eyes;&mdash;the
blackness of forest-gaps by river-marges,
where destruction lay in wait to seize the thirsty;&mdash;the
umbrages of tangled shores concealing
horror;&mdash;the dusk of the python’s lair;&mdash;the
place of hasty refuge echoing the fury of famished
brute and desperate man;&mdash;the place of
burial, and the fancied frightful kinship of the
buried to the cave-haunters:&mdash;all these, and
countless other impressions of the relation of
darkness to death, must have made that ancestral
fear of the dark which haunts the imagination
of the child, and still betimes seizes the
adult as he sleeps in the security of civilization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>Not all the fear of dreams can be the fear of
the immemorial. But that strange nightmare-sensation
of being held by invisible power exerted
from a distance&mdash;is it quite sufficiently
explained by the simple suspension of will-power
during sleep? Or could it be a composite inheritance
of numberless memories of <i>having been
caught</i>? Perhaps the true explanation would
suggest no prenatal experience of monstrous
mesmerisms nor of monstrous webs,&mdash;nothing
more startling than the evolutional certainty that
man, in the course of his development, has left
behind him conditions of terror incomparably
worse than any now existing. Yet enough of
the psychological riddle of nightmare remains
to tempt the question whether human organic
memory holds no record of extinct forms of
pain,&mdash;pain related to strange powers once exerted
by some ghastly vanished life.</p>

<h3>The Eternal Haunter</h3>


<p>This year the Tōkyō color-prints&mdash;<i>Nishiki-è</i>&mdash;seem
to me of unusual interest. They
reproduce, or almost reproduce, the color-charm
of the early broadsides; and they show a
marked improvement in line-drawing. Certainly
one could not wish for anything prettier than the
best prints of the present season.</p>

<p>My latest purchase has been a set of weird
studies,&mdash;spectres of all kinds known to the Far
East, including many varieties not yet discovered
in the West. Some are extremely unpleasant;
but a few are really charming. Here, for example,
is a delicious thing by “Chikanobu,” just published,
and for sale at the remarkable price of
three <i>sen</i>!</p>

<p>Can you guess what it represents?... Yes, a
girl,&mdash;but what kind of a girl? Study it a little....
Very lovely, is she not, with that shy
sweetness in her downcast gaze,&mdash;that light and
dainty grace, as of a resting butterfly?... No,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
she is not some Psyche of the most Eastern East,
in the sense that you mean&mdash;but she is a soul.
Observe that the cherry-flowers falling from the
branch above, are passing <i>through</i> her form. See
also the folds of her robe, below, melting into
blue faint mist. How delicate and vapory the
whole thing is! It gives you the feeling of
spring; and all those fairy colors are the colors
of a Japanese spring-morning.... No, she is
not the personification of any season. Rather
she is a dream&mdash;such a dream as might haunt
the slumbers of Far-Eastern youth; but the artist
did not intend her to represent a dream.... You
cannot guess? Well, she is a tree-spirit,&mdash;the
Spirit of the Cherry-tree. Only in the twilight
of morning or of evening she appears, gliding
about her tree;&mdash;and whoever sees her must love
her. But, if approached, she vanishes back into
the trunk, like a vapor absorbed. There is a
legend of one tree-spirit who loved a man, and
even gave him a son; but such conduct was quite
at variance with the shy habits of her race....</p>

<p>You ask what is the use of drawing the Impossible?
Your asking proves that you do not feel
the charm of this vision of youth,&mdash;this dream
of spring. <i>I</i> hold that the Impossible bears a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
much closer relation to fact than does most of
what we call the real and the commonplace. The
Impossible may not be naked truth; but I think
that it is usually truth,&mdash;masked and veiled, perhaps,
but eternal. Now to me this Japanese
dream is true,&mdash;true, at least, as human love is.
Considered even as a ghost it is true. Whoever
pretends not to believe in ghosts of any sort, lies
to his own heart. Every man is haunted by
ghosts. And this color-print reminds me of a
ghost whom we all know,&mdash;though most of us
(poets excepted) are unwilling to confess the
acquaintance.</p>

<p class="tbpara">Perhaps&mdash;for it happens to some of us&mdash;you
may have seen this haunter, in dreams of the
night, even during childhood. Then, of course,
you could not know the beautiful shape bending
above your rest: possibly you thought her to be
an angel, or the soul of a dead sister. But in
waking life we first become aware of her presence
about the time when boyhood begins to ripen
into youth.</p>

<p>This first of her apparitions is a shock of
ecstasy, a breathless delight; but the wonder and
the pleasure are quickly followed by a sense of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
sadness inexpressible,&mdash;totally unlike any sadness
ever felt before,&mdash;though in her gaze there is
only caress, and on her lips the most exquisite of
smiles. And you cannot imagine the reason of
that feeling until you have learned who she is,&mdash;which
is not an easy thing to learn.</p>

<p>Only a moment she remains; but during that
luminous moment all the tides of your being set
and surge to her with a longing for which there
is not any word. And then&mdash;suddenly!&mdash;she
is not; and you find that the sun has gloomed,
the colors of the world turned grey.</p>

<p>Thereafter enchantment remains between you
and all that you loved before,&mdash;persons or things
or places. None of them will ever seem again so
near and dear as in other days.</p>

<p>Often she will return. Once that you have
seen her she will never cease to visit you. And
this haunting,&mdash;ineffably sweet, inexplicably sad,&mdash;may
fill you with rash desire to wander over
the world in search of somebody like her. But
however long and far you wander, never will you
find that somebody.</p>

<p>Later you may learn to fear her visits because
of the pain they bring,&mdash;the strange pain that
you cannot understand. But the breadth of zones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
and seas cannot divide you from her; walls of
iron cannot exclude her. Soundless and subtle as
a shudder of ether is the motion of her.</p>

<p>Ancient her beauty as the heart of man,&mdash;yet
ever waxing fairer, forever remaining young.
Mortals wither in Time as leaves in the frost of
autumn; but Time only brightens the glow and
the bloom of her endless youth.</p>

<p>All men have loved her;&mdash;all must continue to
love her. But none shall touch with his lips even
the hem of her garment.</p>

<p>All men adore her; yet all she deceives, and
many are the ways of her deception. Most often
she lures her lover into the presence of some
earthly maid, and blends herself incomprehensibly
with the body of that maid, and works such sudden
glamour that the human gaze becomes divine,&mdash;that
the human limbs shine through their raiment.
But presently the luminous haunter detaches
herself from the mortal, and leaves her
dupe to wonder at the mockery of sense.</p>

<p>No man can describe her, though nearly all men
have some time tried to do so. Pictured she cannot
be,&mdash;since her beauty itself is a ceaseless becoming,
multiple to infinitude, and tremulous with
perpetual quickening, as with flowing of light.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a story, indeed, that thousands of years
ago some marvellous sculptor was able to fix in
stone a single remembrance of her. But this
doing became for many the cause of sorrow
supreme; and the Gods decreed, out of compassion,
that to no other mortal should ever be given
power to work the like wonder. In these years
we can worship only;&mdash;we cannot portray.</p>

<p>But who is she?&mdash;what is she?... Ah!
that is what I wanted you to ask. Well, she has
never had a name; but I shall call her a tree-spirit.</p>

<p>The Japanese say that you can exorcise a tree-spirit,&mdash;if
you are cruel enough to do it,&mdash;simply
by cutting down her tree.</p>

<p>But you cannot exorcise the Spirit of whom I
speak,&mdash;nor ever cut down her tree.</p>

<p>For her tree is the measureless, timeless, billion-branching
Tree of Life,&mdash;even the World-Tree,
Yggdrasil, whose roots are in Night and Death,
whose head is above the Gods.</p>

<p>Seek to woo her&mdash;she is Echo. Seek to clasp
her&mdash;she is Shadow. But her smile will haunt
you into the hour of dissolution and beyond,&mdash;through
numberless lives to come.</p>

<p>And never will you return her smile,&mdash;never,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
because of that which it awakens within you,&mdash;the
pain that you cannot understand.</p>

<p>And never, never shall you win to her,&mdash;because
she is the phantom light of long-expired
suns,&mdash;because she was shaped by the beating
of infinite millions of hearts that are dust,&mdash;because
her witchery was made in the endless ebb
and flow of the visions and hopes of youth,
through countless forgotten cycles of your own
incalculable past.</p>

<i>onigawara</i>, or “demon-tiles.” It may naturally be asked
why demon-heads should be ever placed above Buddhist
gate-ways. Originally they were not intended to represent
demons, in the Buddhist sense, but guardian-spirits whose
duty it was to drive demons away. The <i>onigawara</i> were
introduced into Japan either from China or Korea&mdash;not
improbably Korea; for we read that the first roof-tiles
made in Japan were manufactured shortly after the introduction
of the new faith by Korean priests, and under the
supervision of Shōtoku Taishi, the princely founder and
supporter of Japanese Buddhism. They were baked at
Koizumi-mura, in Yamato;&mdash;but we are not told whether
there were any of this extraordinary shape among them.
It is worth while remarking that in Korea to-day you can
see hideous faces painted upon house-doors,&mdash;even upon
the gates of the royal palace; and these, intended merely
to frighten away evil spirits, suggest the real origin of the
demon-tiles. The Japanese, on first seeing such tiles, called
them demon-tiles because the faces upon them resembled
those conventionally given to Buddhist demons; and now
that their history has been forgotten, they are popularly
supposed to represent demon-guardians. There would be
nothing contrary to Buddhist faith in the fancy;&mdash;for
there are many legends of good demons. Besides, in the
eternal order of divine law, even the worst demon must at
last become a Buddha.</p></div>

“stûpa.” Originally a mausoleum, and later a simple
monument&mdash;commemorative or otherwise,&mdash;the stûpa
was introduced with Buddhism into China, and thence,
perhaps by way of Korea, into Japan. Chinese forms of
the stone stûpa are to be found in many of the old Japanese
temple-grounds. The wooden <i>sotoba</i> is only a symbol
of the stûpa; and the more elaborate forms of it plainly
suggest its history. The slight carving along its upper
edges represents that superimposition of cube, sphere,
crescent, pyramid, and body-pyriform (symbolizing the
Five Great Elements), which forms the design of the most
beautiful funeral monuments.</p></div>

of Kobudera was built; and the words “Mansion of Self-witness”
here refer to the temple itself, which is thus
named (<i>Ji-Shō In</i>). The Chinese text reads:&mdash;“Ji-Shō-In
den, Kwo-zan Kyō-kei, Daishi,”&mdash;literally, “Great
Elder-Sister, Dawn-Katsura-of-Luminous-Mountain, dwelling
in the August Mansion of Self-witness.” The katsura
(<i>olea fragrans</i>) is a tree mysteriously connected, in Japanese
poetical fancy, with the moon; and its name is often
used, as here, to signify the moon. <i>Katsura-no-hana</i>, or
“katsura-flower” is a poetical term for moonlight.&mdash;This
kaimyō is remarkable in having the honorific term
“August” prefixed to the name of the mansion or temple,&mdash;a
sign of the high rank of the dead lady. The full date
inscribed is “twenty-eighth day of Mid-Autumn” (the old
eighth month) “of the seventeenth year of Kwansei”
(1640 <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span>)</p></div>

princely birth. The grave is in a reserved part of the Kobudera

Enkyō”&mdash;corresponding to 1747.</p></div>

them in Kobudera. Observe here again the use of the prefix

“child-daughter.” Perhaps the <i>dai</i> here would be better
rendered by “grand” than by “great.” Notice that the
term “August” precedes the mansion-name in this case also.
The date of death is given as “the sixth year of Hōreki”
(1756).</p></div>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
